      <h1 id="stakeholders">Stakeholders</h1>
<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>A stakeholder is any individual, group, or organisation with a direct interest in, and is affected by the activities and performance of a business.</p>
<h1 id="types-of-stakeholders">Types of Stakeholders</h1>
<h2 id="internal-stakeholders">Internal Stakeholders</h2>
<p>Stakeholders that are members of the organisation.</p>
<h3 id="employees">Employees</h3>
<p>Employees are a very important stakeholder group, as they are the ones who make a business possible, and some even argue that they may be the most important one. They strive to improve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay</li>
<li>Financial Benefits</li>
<li>Working Conditions</li>
<li>Job Security</li>
<li>Opportunities for career progression</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="managers-and-directors">Managers and Directors</h3>
<p>Managers are the ones who oversee the daily operations of a business, and thus have a keen interest on the company. They aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximise own benefits (perks, bonuses, etc.)</li>
<li>Profit Maximisation</li>
<li>Please other stakeholders</li>
<li>Long term financial health of the business.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="shareholders">Shareholders</h3>
<p>Limited liability companies are owned by shareholders, and invest money in a business by purchasing shares. This makes them very powerful and have a ‘say’ in how the company is run. They aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximise Dividends</li>
<li>To achieve a <em>capital gain</em> in the value of shares/ a rise in the share price</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="external-stakeholders">External Stakeholders</h2>
<p>Stakeholders that are not part of the business, but have a direct interest or involvement in the organisation</p>
<h3 id="customers">Customers</h3>
<p>This is quite obviously very important as without customers to buy the product, there would be no business at all. It is very important to keep them happy, or else they have the ability to take their interests to a competitor, which could be done by market research, surveys, and satisfying their aims of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competitive prices</li>
<li>High quality products</li>
<li>Customer support</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="suppliers">Suppliers</h3>
<p>They provide businesses with stocks of raw materials, component parts, and finished goods needed for production. It is important to keep them happy as they can offer credit if cash is not immediately available, and preference over other businesses. This could be done by:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Time payments</li>
<li>Good relations and communication</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pressure-groups">Pressure Groups</h3>
<p>these consist of individuals with a common interest who seek to place demands on organisations to act in a particular way or to influence a change in their behaviour. This in itself shows the power they hold, as they could protest against certain practices of a business, therefore they should be kept happy. This could be done by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring ethical practices are followed</li>
<li>Stay aware of changing trends and possible threats</li>
<li>Engage in mutual discussions to keep good relations</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="competitors">Competitors</h3>
<p>They are the rival businesses of an organisation and they might be interested in their operation because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rivalry can create and incentive to be innovative</li>
<li>To remain competitive, stay aware of their position</li>
<li>To benchmark performance and compare key indicators such as sales turnover, and profit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="government">Government</h3>
<p>They are important as they can have significant influence on business activity such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unfair business practices are avoided</li>
<li>Correct amount of taxes are paid</li>
<li>Health and safety standards are met</li>
<li>Compliance with employment legislation occurs</li>
<li>Consumer protection laws are upheld</li>
</ul>
<p>Their ultimate aim is to ensure that a business acts in the public’s interests. They can also offer subsidised rent and tax concessions to MNCs among many other functions.</p>
<h2 id="stakeholder-conflict">Stakeholder Conflict</h2>
<p>It refers to the inability of an organisation to meet all of its stakeholder objectives simultaneously, due to differences in varying needs of all its stakeholder groups.</p>
<p>For example, if shareholders want more profit, then it might occur as a result of cutting staff benefits, which creates a conflict of interests between the two groups. Another example is the conflict between businesses (managers) and suppliers, as the latter would want to receive the full price of the transaction to improve their cash flow, while businesses expect discounts and other benefits for ordering regularly and buying in bulk.</p>
<p>There are numerous such conflicts and can be analysed through the case. Other issues to look at when dealing with conflicts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The type of organisation in question</li>
<li>The aims and objectives of the business</li>
<li>The source and degree of power</li>
</ul>
