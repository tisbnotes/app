<h2 id="economies-of-scale">Economies of Scale</h2>
<p>The <strong>fall</strong> in average costs of production as a firm increases its size.</p>
<h4 id="average-costs">Average Costs</h4>
<p>It is the cost per unit of output and is calculated by dividing the total costs by the total output. Total costs are calculated by adding fixed costs to variable costs.</p>
<h3 id="internal-economies-of-scale">Internal Economies of Scale</h3>
<h4 id="technical-economies">Technical Economies</h4>
<p>Large firms can use sophistaicated machinery to mass produce their products. Therefore the high fixed costs can be spread over the large scale of output, thereby reducing average costs.</p>
<h4 id="financial-economies">Financial Economies</h4>
<p>Large firms find it easier to borrow massive sums of money at low rates of interest than small firms borrowing less money, which is because they are deemed to be less risky and can provide sufficient collateral.</p>
<h4 id="managerial-economies">Managerial Economies</h4>
<p>Large firms can hire specialist managers that can ensure higher productivity and efficiency, therefore reducing the average costs.</p>
<h4 id="specialisation-economies">Specialisation Economies</h4>
<p>It is similar to managerial, however it refers to the division of labour rather than the management itself. Workers can be more skilled and experienced in one particular aspect over most workers, thus raising productivity and reducing average costs.</p>
<h4 id="marketing-economies">Marketing Economies</h4>
<p>Large firms can benefit from lower average costs by selling in bulk, thus benefiting from reduced time and transaction costs.</p>
<h4 id="purchasing-economies">Purchasing Economies</h4>
<p>When large firms buy resources in bulk, they often get discounts that reduces average costs, so the higher the order, they greater fall in average costs.</p>
<h4 id="risk-bearing-economies">Risk-Bearing Economies</h4>
<p>Firms that have diversified their product lines, can benefit from this as the risks would be spread, therefore not jeopardising the whole business if one product fails.</p>
<h3 id="external-economies-of-scale">External Economies of Scale</h3>
<h4 id="technological-progress">Technological Progress</h4>
<p>The progress in the entire economy of technology increases the productivity of the entire industry.</p>
<h4 id="improved-transportation-networks">Improved Transportation Networks</h4>
<p>They aid in prompt deliveries and reducing tardiness from workers which would have otherwise negatively affected the productivity.</p>
<h4 id="skilled-labour-availability">Skilled Labour Availability</h4>
<p>If more skilled labourers are available in an economy, it would cut costs in looking extensively for suitable options, as well as increase the overall productivity.</p>
<h4 id="regional-specialisation">Regional Specialisation</h4>
<p>If a country specialises in one industry or product, it would provide easier access to skilled labour and equipment, therefore reducing average costs. They could also charge higher prices if the country is well known for the products.</p>
<h2 id="diseconomies-of-scale">Diseconomies of Scale</h2>
<p>The <strong>increase</strong> in average costs of production as a firm increases in size</p>
<h3 id="internal-diseconomies-of-scale">Internal Diseconomies of Scale</h3>
<h4 id="loss-of-control-and-coordination">Loss of Control and Coordination</h4>
<p>If a business grows too large, it will become very difficult to control and coordinate with the increasing number of departments, therefore reducing productivity and raising average costs.</p>
<h4 id="overspecialisation">Overspecialisation</h4>
<p>If firms become too specialised, it might cause problems such as boredom of workers, which leads to lower productivity and efficiency.</p>
<h4 id="bureaucracy">Bureaucracy</h4>
<p>Paperwork, policies, and administration is likely to increase as a firm grows larger, therefore becoming more time-consuming and adds to costs of a business. It might also affect communication.</p>
<h4 id="complacency">Complacency</h4>
<p>If firms become too cocky and confident, it might lead to slacking and boredom, which reduces productivity, therefore raising the average costs.</p>
<h3 id="external-diseconomies-of-scale">External Diseconomies of Scale</h3>
<h4 id="examples">Examples:</h4>
<h4 id="increasing-market-rents">Increasing Market Rents</h4>
<p>This adds costs to the business without actually affecting the output positively.</p>
<h4 id="higher-wages-etc.">Higher Wages etc.</h4>
<p>Firms might have to offer larger wages and financial rewards if there are too many competitors, to keep their workers and possible gain new ones from the competitors. This raises costs, leading to higher average costs.</p>
<h4 id="traffic-congestion">Traffic Congestion</h4>
<p>If many businesses are located in one area, it might cause heavy traffic, which increases transportation costs among others.</p>
<h2 id="small-vs-large-organisations">Small vs Large Organisations</h2>

</table><h2 id="globalization">Globalization</h2>
<p>The growing integration and interdependence of the world’s economies, causing national economies to integrate towards a single global economy, where consumers have increasing similarity of habits and tastes.</p>
<h3 id="opportunities">Opportunities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increases level of competition, reducing wastes and increasing efficiency.</li>
<li>Increase in customer base, especially for MNCs.</li>
<li><strong>Economies of Scale</strong> (global marketing economies and risk-bearing economies)</li>
<li>Greater choice of location, helping reduce costs of production, and find a suitable location.</li>
<li>External growth opportunities increase</li>
<li>Increased sources of finance.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are occasional disadvantages as well, as meeting consumer expectations becomes more and more difficult, and some of these can be seen as threats as well, such as increased competition making survival more difficult, and possibly enabling <strong>Diseconomies of Scale.</strong></p>
<h2 id="multinational-companies">Multinational Companies</h2>
<p>MNCs are organizations that operate in two or more countries. This form is becoming more and more popular for these reasons:</p>
<h3 id="advantages-5">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increased customer base</li>
<li>Cheaper production costs (such as cheap labour and subsidies in some locations)</li>
<li><strong>Economies of Scale</strong></li>
<li>Avoid protectionist policies such as taxes, tariffs, and quotas.</li>
<li>Spread risks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tariffs</strong>- tax on imports, adding price to foreign goods<br>
<strong>Quotas</strong>- Quantitative limits imposed on the sale of imports, resulting in lower supply.<br>
<strong>Restrictive Trade Practices</strong>- acts that unfairly, though not illegally, discriminate aginst foreign firms.</p>
<p>A <strong>host country</strong> is any nation that allows MNCs to set up in its country. These are their advantages and drawbacks:</p>
<h3 id="advantages-6">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create jobs in the country, reducing unemployment</li>
<li>Boosts GDP, therefore aiding in economic growth</li>
<li>Introduces new skills and technology to the country</li>
<li>Intensifies competition, therefore reducing waste and increasing efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages-1">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can <strong>cause</strong> unemployment, as they pose a threat to domestic firms, forcing some to close or become less competitive, both leading to job losses.</li>
<li>Profits can be sent back/<strong>repatriated</strong> to the home country, and danger of MNCs suddenly leaving for other countries/locations.</li>
<li>Lack of Social Responsibility leading to resource depletion among others.</li>
<li>Fierce competitiveness can make domestic firms vulnerable to takeovers as they might not be financially strong enough to compete.</li>
</ul>
