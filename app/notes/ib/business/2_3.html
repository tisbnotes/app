<h2 id="key-functions-of-management">Key Functions of Management</h2>
<p>There are a variety of different methods and theories that can be used to identify the basic functions of a manager.</p>
<h2 id="fayols-functions">Fayol’s Functions:</h2>
<p>Can be remembered as PCOCC/Peacock</p>
<h3 id="planning">Planning</h3>
<p>Managers are responsible for setting the course of action to achieve organisational objectives and are involved in setting both tactical (short-term) and strategic (long-term)</p>
<h3 id="commanding">Commanding</h3>
<p>Managers give instructions and orders to their teams and subordinates in order to achieve business objectives. They enforce discipline and productivity in the workplace</p>
<h3 id="organising">Organising</h3>
<p>Managers have the responsibility to organise resources in order to achieve corporate objectives. This might include delegating or allocating tasks to workers to ensure that deadlines are met.</p>
<h3 id="controlling">Controlling</h3>
<p>Managers are responsible for the performance and health and safety of their teams. Corrective measures should be taken if targets are not met.</p>
<h3 id="coordinating">Coordinating</h3>
<p>Managers have the responsibility for ensuring that all departments strive to achieve the goals of the organisation. They coordinate between the different departments to gain a steady flow.</p>
<h2 id="handys-functions">Handy’s Functions:</h2>
<h3 id="managers-as-general-practitioners">Managers as General Practitioners</h3>
<p>Handling problems related to well being of a firm, such as labour turnover, productivity and customer satisfaction.</p>
<h3 id="managers-as-confronters-of-dilemmas">Managers as Confronters of Dilemmas</h3>
<p>Taking the best possible decision amongst many possible decisions available, take responsibility of managing stakeholders and organisational conflict.</p>
<h3 id="managers-as-balancers-of-cultural-mixes">Managers as Balancers of Cultural Mixes</h3>
<p>Maintain cordial relations in the teams and get the best out of each employee by understanding what motivates that employee. They also reinforce the common organisational culture among the staff to cut across differences in individual cultures.</p>
<p>Handy argued that mangers need the <strong>Helicopter Factor</strong>, which means to see the big picture, in order to handle these roles.</p>
<h2 id="druckers-functions">Drucker’s Functions</h2>
<p>He believed that managers should not micro-manage the employees after a certain extent, as he believed in decentralisation at workplace. He therefore believed that their roles should consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting organisational objectives</li>
<li>Organising tasks and people</li>
<li>Communicating with and motivating employees</li>
<li>Measuring performance</li>
<li>Developing people- job enrichment opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="difference-between-leaders-and-managers">Difference between Leaders and Managers</h2>
<p>A leader is someone who influences and inspires others to get things done. He fosters motivation, respect, trust, and loyalty from the workforce. Managers, on the other idea just try to set objectives and run the business efficiently, no matter the method. These two terms are often used interchangeably, which is fine for most parts. However it is important to understand their differences for specific questions. These include:</p>
<h3 id="time-and-devotion">Time and Devotion</h3>
<p>Management is often referred to as a 9-5 job, whereas Leadership is a full 24 hours per day job. Managers have a short term view, whereas leaders have a longer-term perspective.</p>
<h3 id="roles-and-responsibilities">Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Leaders are accountable for a much broader range of roles and responsibilities. They deal with what or why questions and are therefore innovative thinkers. By contrast, Managers deal with routine how and when questions.</p>
<h3 id="influence-on-others">Influence on Others</h3>
<p>Instructions and orders from managers are listened to because they come from an official position of authority. Leaders are, however, listened to because they want to listen, through motivation and inspiration to execute actions. They focus on people rather than tasks.</p>
<h3 id="risk-taking">Risk-taking</h3>
<p>Managers follow predetermined rules and regulations set by the organisation, in order to keep order and control. Leaders on the on the other hand, are more radical in their thinking. They take risks by challenging the status quo to move the organisation forward.</p>
<h3 id="vision">Vision</h3>
<p>Some theorists believe that it is the vision of leaders that distinguish between them and Managers. Leaders create a culture of hope, whereas managers abide by the procedures and and cultures of an organisation.</p>
<h2 id="leadership-styles">Leadership Styles</h2>
<p>It refers to the ways in which decision makers behave or reveal their behaviour. There are five common styles of leadership, which include Autocratic, Paternalistic, Democratic, Laissez-Faire, and Situational.</p>
<h2 id="autocratic-leadership">Autocratic Leadership</h2>
<p>An autocratic leader simply tells their subordinates what to do and prefers not to delegate any responsibility. It is suitable in situations that require quick decision-making or when critical decision have to be made.</p>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Decisions are made quickly</li>
<li>Mistakes made by employees of delegated work reduces</li>
<li>Conflicts of ideas and opinions is minimised</li>
<li>Provides a clear line of control</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increases work burden for managers through lack of delegation</li>
<li>Can lead to demotivation and alienation as opinions and suggestions are mostly ignored</li>
<li>Bad for skilled workers whose talents may be wasted</li>
<li>Can create bad image for job applicants and can cause labour turnover</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="paternalistic-leadership">Paternalistic Leadership</h2>
<p>These managers treat their employees as if they were family members by acting in their best interests and guiding them with their problems. They tend to have exceptional organisational skills and build trust with their teams. There are two different views of this method, <strong>negative paternalistic style</strong> which occurs when the managers perceive workers as less capable and leads bu guidance and control, and <strong>positive paternalistic style</strong> which occurs when employees are perceived as more capable and are nurtured and developed instead.</p>
<h3 id="advantages-1">Advantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Employee loyalty is developed in the workforce</li>
<li>Motivation is induced as employees feel wanted and are listened to</li>
<li>Reduces labour turnover and absenteeism</li>
<li>New opinions and ideas flow into the business</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages-1">Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can be seen as informal and inappropriate amongst business partners and general public</li>
<li>Firm hierarchy isn’t set, causing confusion and internal problems</li>
<li>Dependency on leaders are created</li>
<li>Inappropriate for flatter, informal structures where creative thinking is required.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="democratic-leadership">Democratic Leadership</h2>
<p>These managers directly involve the employees in the decision-making process.They consult the staff and consider their views before making any final decision.</p>
<h3 id="advantages-2">Advantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increases motivation and morale as their opinions and ideas are heard</li>
<li>Reduces workload of managers as delegation is used</li>
<li>Delegation can train and develop employees</li>
<li>Many ideas and suggestions flow into the business</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages-2">Disadvantages</h3>

<li>Decision-making is slower as many people are consulted</li>
<li>Not suitable for large organisations with a big workforce</li>
<li>Conflicts between ideas and opinions can arise</li>
<li>Costs can increase through wasted time, also reducing productivity</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="laissez-faire-leadership">Laissez-Faire Leadership</h2>
<p>These managers have minimal direct input on the employees and instead allow employees to make their own decisions and complete their work their own way. Leaders set the objectives but it is up to the employees on how they go about achieving it.</p>
<h3 id="advantages-3">Advantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li>High motivation levels may arise through trust and acceptance of employees</li>
<li>Workers feel as if they have complete control over their work, contributing even more to the business</li>
<li>Suitable for business that require creative thinking</li>
<li>Workload of managers are minimised as they do not have to do much</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages-3">Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Coordination and control is lost as decision-making can be time-consuming</li>
<li>Confusion can arise, causing low productivity of the workforce</li>
<li>Not suitable for businesses that require quick decision-making</li>
<li>Mistakes made by employees also increases as there is no direct supervision.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="situational-leadership">Situational Leadership</h2>
<p>Unlike the other styles, this does not depend on any one single approach, and is instead determined by the situation at hand. For example, if there is a crisis, autocratic leadership can be used, and laissez-faire can be used for skilled and empowered employees.</p>
<h3 id="factors-affecting-style-used-clots">Factors Affecting Style Used (CLOTS):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Culture of Business</li>
<li>Leader (preferences, experience, trust levels etc)</li>
<li>Organisational Structure</li>
<li>Task (Urgency, difficulty, skill level etc)</li>
<li>Subordinates (level of skill, motivation, number etc)</li>
</ul>
