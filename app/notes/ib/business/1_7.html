<p>The various methods that businesses use to aid their decision making. These tools enable businesses to deal with their problems, issues or concerns in a systematic manner.</p>
<h2 id="fishbone-diagram">Fishbone Diagram</h2>
<p>A graphical representation of the most likely causes and effects of an important decision. The base structure looks like this (for IB, replace Methods with <strong>Management</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.toolshero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/fishbone-diagram-ishikawa-diagram-toolshero.jpg" alt="Image result for fishbone diagram"></p>
<p>Therefore the causes can be segregated into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management (unsuitable style, miscommunication etc)</li>
<li>Manpower (unskilled workers, lack of training etc)</li>
<li>Machinery (technological failures, faulty equipment etc)</li>
<li>Materials (poor quality, delayed deliveries etc)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps-to-construct-a-fishbone-diagram">Steps to Construct a Fishbone Diagram</h3>
<ol>
<li>Problem or issue must be clearly stated</li>
<li>Contributors must be concise and to the point</li>
<li>For each ‘bone’, brainstorm the possible causes and place in the node.</li>
<li>Consider combining nodes that are empty(ish), or remove altogether</li>
<li>Consider separating overcrowded nodes</li>
<li>Consider which root causes warrant further investigation and circle them</li>
<li>Discuss how each circled item affects the issue being investigated.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="strengths">Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use and understand</li>
<li>Allows decision making to be logical, systematic, and concise</li>
<li>Facilitates a visual diagnosis of the problem</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Simplistic for real-world problems</li>
<li>Has to be used along with other tools to be justifiable</li>
<li>Can’t quantify the problem</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="decision-trees">Decision Trees</h2>
<p>A quantitative decision making tool and a diagrammatic representation of the different options that are available to a business. It calculates the expected value of each decision so that one with higher benefits can be made.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tutor2u-media/subjects/business/diagrams/decision-tree-stage2.png?mtime=20150822075542" alt="Image result for decision tree"></p>
<h3 id="how-to-make-a-decision-tree">How to Make a Decision Tree</h3>
<ul>
<li>Decision nodes are shown as squares and show the main decision that has to be made.</li>
<li>Chance Nodes are shown as circles, which show the different possible outcomes of a decision (usually follow pattern of ‘failure or success’)</li>
<li>For each chance node there will be two or more routes (outcomes) which show the probability of the different outcomes. The probabilities must add up to 1.</li>
<li>The actual values are then stated at the end of each branch, then the costs of each option must be deducted to calculate net figure of each outcome.</li>
<li>Each unwanted branch of the decision tree is cut off/rejected, which is shown by two consecutive parallel lines, leaving only the best option.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>They allow managers to set out problems in a clear and logical manner.</li>
<li>All potential options can be seen at the same time, thereby speeding up decision-making.</li>
<li>They consider the risks involved in decision-making, such as possible negative outcomes.</li>
<li>They enable more scientific and objective decisions to be made as all likely costs of the decisions are considered.</li>
<li>As a visual stimulus, they provide a tangible insight to a problem. They also make use of quantitative analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>The probabilities given in a decision tree are only estimates and can have forecasting errors.</li>
<li>They are based on <strong>only</strong> quantitative data, thereby rendering qualitative issues useless and ignored.</li>
<li>The technique does not necessarily reduce the amount of risk involved in decision making.</li>
<li>Delays in the planning process can void the data by the time a decision is made.</li>
<li>The task of assigning probabilities is rather subjective so results can be deliberately biased to justify the preference of the management.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="force-field-analysis">Force Field Analysis</h2>
<p>A simple tool that applies weight to forces that drive change and forces that restrain it.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mindtools.com/media/Diagrams/Forces_for_change_v2.png" alt="Image result for force field analysis"></p>
<p>The size of the arrows can vary if wanted, depending on the weight applied to it.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-make-a-force-field-analysis">How to Make a Force Field Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>List the driving forces for change and the restraining forces against it.</li>
<li>Allocate a weight to each of these factors from 1-5, 1 being weak and 5 being strong,</li>
<li>Draw the diagram as shown above, but apply the weights and labels to the arrows.</li>
<li>Total the scores for the driving and restraining forces, decision can be made based on to which is higher.</li>
</ul>
<p>This tool is very basic and depends on opinions and basic data to assign weights, and can be used only with other tools.</p>
<h2 id="gantt-charts">Gantt Charts</h2>
<p>A visual representation of all the tasks in a particular project plotted against time scale. It is used to plan and schedule business projects, allowing easier supervision and sets deadlines.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails.venngage.com/template/6a47f731-e69a-4578-a02c-037d03adf765.png" alt="Image result for gantt chart"></p>
<h3 id="how-to-make-a-gantt-chart">How to Make A Gantt Chart</h3>
<ul>
<li>Presented as a bar chart showing all scheduled tasks (vertical axis) over a given time scale ( horizontal axis).</li>
<li>Each activity is shown by a separate rectangular bar, with the length depicting the duration required to complete it. Each bar shows start and end date, as well as the duration.</li>
<li>Both critical and non-critical tasks are shown</li>
<li>Predecessor-Successor relationships are shown.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main goal of a this chart is to minimise the amount of time it would take to complete the projects, as well as set deadlines for the workers to abide by and give a sense of direction. However it is only an estimate and cannot accurately quantify the required time.</p>
