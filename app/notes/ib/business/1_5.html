<h4 id="opportunities">Opportunities</h4>
<p>external factors that present chances for businesses.</p>
<h4 id="threats">Threats</h4>
<p>external factors that can harm a business</p>
<h2 id="steeple-analysis">STEEPLE Analysis</h2>
<p>STEEPLE is an acronym for Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political, Legal, and Ethical opportunities and threats of the external business environment. These factors affect businesses yet cannot be controlled by any individual organisation.</p>
<h4 id="advantages">ADVANTAGES</h4>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Thorough and logical</li>
<li>Useful brainstorming and discussion tool</li>
<li>Proactive and forward thinking</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="social">Social</h2>
<p>Social, cultural and demographic factors can directly affect the activities of a business. The opportunities and threats could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Ethics</li>
<li>Social Welfare</li>
<li>Women</li>
<li>Religion</li>
<li>Animal Rights</li>
<li>Language</li>
<li>Demographic Changes</li>
</ul>
<p>The organisation’s views on these issues could result in them being regarded as either opportunities or threats.</p>
<h2 id="technological">Technological</h2>
<p>The technological environment of the location at hand presents constant threats and opportunities. Advances in technology have improved productivity, however the high cost of staying up-to-date with these advancements can cause problems. Technology affects all aspects of a business and has various opportunities and threats.</p>
<h4 id="examples-of-opportunities">Examples of Opportunities</h4>
<ul>
<li>New working practices</li>
<li>Increased productivity and efficiency gains</li>
<li>Quicker product development time</li>
<li>Job creation</li>
<li>New products and new markets</li>
<li>ETC.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="examples-of-threats">Examples of Threats</h4>
<ul>
<li>Technology is not always reliable</li>
<li>Shorter life cycles of technology</li>
<li>Costly to keep up-to-date</li>
<li>Job Losses</li>
<li>ETC.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="economic">Economic</h2>
<p>The economic environment refers to the state of the economy in which the business operates/plans to operate in. This is determined by the government’s ability to achieve the 4 key economic objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Controlled Inflation</li>
<li>Reduced Unemployment</li>
<li>Economic Growth (GDP)</li>
<li>Healthy International Trade Balance</li>
</ul>
<p>*refer to book for minute details.</p>
<p>The resultant state of the economy can be opportunities and threats, if it is developing/developed with all objectives being satisfied to a certain extent, it could present itself as opportunities, depending on the business.</p>
<h2 id="environmental">Environmental</h2>
<p>Individuals, organisations and governments are increasingly concerned about the negative impacts of business activity on the natural environment. Without government intervention, private sector businesses are unlikely to follow strict environment-friendly practices, which could either be an opportunity or a threat to a business.</p>
<p>External costs, such as fumes from cigarettes and noise pollution are increasing and businesses need to keep that in mind when choosing a location, as a place with too many such problems could become expensive and time-consuming to follow practices.</p>
<p>The extent to which businesses consider environmental issues depends on their aims, attitudes, and likely impact on their profits and resources. If compliance costs are too high, businesses might not follow them.</p>
<p>Weather and seasonal changes are also important opportunities/threats, depending on the industry of the firm, or the danger level of the location.</p>
<h2 id="political">Political</h2>
<p>The political stability of a country and the policies they follow (taxes and interest rates) can provide both opportunities and threats.</p>
<p>Too many policies and the level of stringency can become a threat as it could become more expensive and time consuming for businesses if taxes, for example, are higher than usual. The opposite way could be regarded as an opportunity or a threat, depending on the business’ outlook.</p>
<h3 id="policies">Policies</h3>
<h4 id="fiscal-policy">Fiscal Policy</h4>
<p>The use of taxation and government expenditure to influence business activities the economy. It could be <strong>deflationary</strong>, where the taxes are higher and government expenditure falls, to reduce inflation, or <strong>expansionary</strong>, where taxes are reduced and govt. expenditure increases to stimulate consumption in the economy.</p>
<h4 id="monetary-policy">Monetary Policy</h4>
<p>The use of interest rates to affect the money supply and exchange rates in order to influence business activity. The rates could be increased to raise the cost of borrowing, as this would reduce the disposable income and therefore reduce consumption to reduce inflation. It could also be reduced to make borrowing more attractive, and therefore increase consumption in the economy.</p>
<h4 id="deregulation">Deregulation</h4>
<p>The removal of government rules and regulations which constrain business activity within a particular industry. This would therefore enhance efficiency and encourage more competiton within the industry.</p>
<h2 id="legal">Legal</h2>
<p>The government imposes rules, regulations, and laws to ensure that the general public is protected from adverse business activity.Some common legislations affecting the business could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumer Protection Legislation</li>
<li>Employee Protection Legislation</li>
<li>Competition Legislation’</li>
<li>Social and Environmental Protection Legislation</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these ensure that a particular party’s rights are protected, but they can be time consuming and expensive for businesses to follow, making it a threat. However, it could be viewed as an opportunity as it ensures ethical and fair practices, if the business could benefit from that.</p>
<h2 id="ethical">Ethical</h2>
<p>Business ethics are the moral principles that are, or should be, considered in decision-making. Firms that are ethical are usually socially responsible towards all of their stakeholders, and this could end up benefitting them, as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attract and Retain good quality workers</li>
<li>Attract and retain existing ones</li>
<li>Social responsibility generates good publicity</li>
<li>Also generates good public relations</li>
</ul>
<p>These could end up with the business earning higher profits. However, this could also be regarded as threats, as once again, they are time consuming and quite expensive to follow.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Therefore, these aspects of the STEEPLE Analysis provide a deeper and simpler understanding of possible opportunities and threats, and can be very useful for businesses if used correctly.</p>
