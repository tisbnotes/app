<li>Performance management and staff appraisals</li>
<li>Reviewing pay and remuneration packages</li>

<p>So um yeah, they’re quite important to a business.</p>
<h1 id="workforcehuman-resource-planning">Workforce/Human Resource Planning</h1>

<p><strong>A workforce plan includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Careful consideration of current abilities and what will be needed in the future (short-term or long-term)</li>
<li>Identifying gaps and considering ways of addressing these</li>
<li>Noting any training needs</li>

<ul>
<li>Historical data: average length of service, labor turnover rate, etc.</li>
<li>Workload, specializations and flexibility of workforce</li>
<li>e.g. flexible workforce can deal with sudden shortage of staff</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Others that are included in workforce planning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work study (time and motion study or efficiency studies)</li>
<li>Derived demand (from forecast output)</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Staff/labor turnover:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Percentage of workforce that leaves the company in a time period</li>
<li>(Number of leavers / Total number of staff) x 100</li>
<li>Low turnover suggests good workforce planning and recruitment</li>
<li>High turnover suggests incompetent employees and poor job satisfaction</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons why people leave their jobs:</strong></p>

<li>Demand for customisation is increasing</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="r’s-of-problems-caused-due-to-poor-workforce-planning">5 R’s of Problems Caused Due to Poor Workforce Planning</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Recruitment -Higher costs of recruitment and training</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources – increasing amount of resources spent on dealing with workforce planning instead of production or marketing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reservations- existing staff may have lower morale and uncertainty if the staff keeps changing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Returns- lower levels of profits and productivity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reputation- poor corporate image of the firm in the industry</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Firms should ensure that their employee have high workforce flexibility by acknowledging the need for continuous professional development.</p>
