<blockquote>
<p>On our Eid day my cousin was sent to<br>
the village. Something happened. We think it was pain.<br>
She gave wheat to the miller and the miller<br>
gave her the flour. Afterwards it did not hurt,<br>
so for a while she made chapatis. <em>Tasleen,</em><br>
<em>said her friends, Tasleen, do come out with us.</em></p>
<p>They were in a coy near the swing, It’s like<br>
a field. Sometimes we planted melons, spinach,<br>
marrow, and there was a well. She sat on the swing,<br>
They pushed her back till she shouted, Stop the swing,<br>
then she was sick. Tasleen told them to find<br>
help. She made blood beneath the mango tree.</p>
<p>Her mother held her down. She thought something<br>
was burning her stomach. We paint our hands.<br>
We visit. We take each other money.<br>
Outside, the children played Jack-with-Five-Stones.<br>
Each day she’d carried water from the well<br>
into the Mosque. Men washed and prayed to God.</p>
<p>After an hour she died. Her mother cried.<br>
They called a Holy Man. He walked from Dina<br>
to Jhang Chak. He saw her dead, then said,<br>
<em>She went out at noon and the ghost took her heart.</em><br>
From that day we were warned not to do this.<br>
Baarh is a small red fruit. We guard our hearts.</p>

<ul>
<li>Raises concerns about</li>
<li>Themes:
<ul>
<li>Patriarchy</li>
<li>Pain/molestation</li>
<li>Ill-treatment of women</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Narrated by a young girl - matter of fact.
<ul>
<li>Increases dramatic effect, the girl is oblivious to what happened</li>
<li>Significance of title - ‘girl talking’ - is</li>
<li>The readers can infer from what she said</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Duffy keeps her language very precise and non-emotional
<ul>
<li>Precision of language shows the indifference of society</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The ambiguity in the timeline of the poem shows the situation’s generality
<ul>
<li>Anyone can face these circumstances</li>
<li>Tasleen’s problems are timeless</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Regular structure
<ul>
<li>shows the fixed, unmoving structure of society</li>
<li>Women are completely crushed by it, cannot speak up or do what they went</li>
<li>no scope of change</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Undeveloped sentences
<ul>
<li>Direct</li>
<li>Keeps the pace moving, which shows the readers how fast everyone got over it</li>
<li>This event is something that people reflect about only after it has happened - the pace of the poem allows Duffy to have the reader only reflect about the event after the poem concludes.</li>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>On our Eid day my cousin was sent to<br>
the village. Something happened. We think it was pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Ambiguity in what happened</li>
<li>The child’s use of the word ‘pain’ hints at the nature of the activity</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>She gave wheat to the miller and the miller</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Millers were considered untrustworthy characters.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>gave her the flour. Afterwards it did not hurt,</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Ironic</li>
<li>Duffy does not mention what happened</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>so for a while she made chapatis. <em>Tasleen,</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Emphasises gender stereotypes</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>said her friends, Tasleen, do come out with us.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Her friends are completely oblivious regarding what happened to her</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>They were in a coy near the swing, It’s like<br>
a field. Sometimes we planted melons, spinach,</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Lexical cluster of agriculture</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>marrow, and there was a well. She sat on the swing,<br>
They pushed her back till she shouted, Stop the swing,</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Swinging might be a metaphor for her breaking some sort of boundary</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>then she was sick. Tasleen told them to find<br>
help. She made blood beneath the mango tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The mango tree represents fertility</li>
<li>“Made blood” - euphemism for miscarriage</li>
<li>Tasleen lost her child under the mango tree</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Her mother held her down. She thought something<br>
was burning her stomach. We paint our hands.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The naive interpretation of the narrator contrasts with the gravity of the situation</li>
<li>Only her mother is helping her</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We visit. We take each other money.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Short sentences show the erratic nature of the situation</li>
<li>Indifference of society</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Outside, the children played Jack-with-Five-Stones.<br>
Each day she’d carried water from the well</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Tasleen is working and toiling for the benefit of men</li>
<li>Reflects the overarching theme of partiarchy</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>into the Mosque. Men washed and prayed to God.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The fact that this is happening on Eid day is ironic:</li>
<li>Eid day is supposed to be a day of joy and festivities</li>
<li>However, she was raped and subject to a miscarriage</li>
<li>Men can ‘wash’ their sins away, whereas Tasleen’s sins will be worn by her forever</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>After an hour she died. Her mother cried.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Honest, naive narration by the child.</li>
<li>There is no exaggeration.</li>
<li>Only the mother cried - shows the indifference of society.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>They called a Holy Man. He walked from Dina</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Theme of male dominance</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>to Jhang Chak. He saw her dead, then said,<br>
<em>She went out at noon and the ghost took her heart.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>She never ‘went’ out, she was sent.</li>
<li>Going out represents crossing boundaries. However, Tasleen never did any of this.</li>
<li>The holy man’s explanation is very simplistic and effortless —&gt; sham, covering up of the incident.</li>
<li>The miller’s sins are being covered up, and Tasleen is being blamed.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>From that day we were warned not to do this.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In this society, this event was viewed as Tasleen’s fault.</li>
<li>Girls are targeted rather than helped.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Baarh is a small red fruit. We guard our hearts.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Baarh is the fruit from the holiest tree in Islamic culture. Represents:
<ul>
<li>Temptation</li>
<li>Virginity</li>
<li>Passion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The children ‘guard their hearts’:
<ul>
<li>Resist their temptations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
