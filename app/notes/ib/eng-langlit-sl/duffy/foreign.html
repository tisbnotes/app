<h2 id="poem">Poem</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine living in a strange, dark city for twenty years.<br>
There are some dismal dwellings on the east side<br>
and one of them is yours. On the landing, you hear<br>
your foreign accent echo down the stairs. You think<br>
in a language of your own and talk in theirs.</p>
<p>Then you are writing home. The voice in your head<br>
Recites the letter in a local dialect; behind that<br>
Is the sound of your mother singing to you,<br>
All that time ago, and now you do not know<br>
Why your eyes are watering and what’s the word for this.</p>
<p>You use the public transport. Work. Sleep. Imagine one night<br>
You saw a name for yourself sprayed in red<br>
against a brick wall. A hate name. Red like blood.<br>
It is snowing in the streets, under the neon lights,<br>
as if this place were coming to bits before your eyes.</p>
<p>And in the delicatessen, from time to time, the coins<br>
in your palm will not translate. Inarticulate,<br>
because this is not home, you point at the fruit. Imagine<br>
that one of you says, <em>Me not know what these people mean.</em><br>
*It like they only go to bed and dream.*Imagine that.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="general-analysis">General Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>The cyclic nature of the poem demands the audience to empathise with the speaker.</li>
<li>The persona is an immigrant from an impoverished country who is still struggling to fit in to his/her new ‘home’ even after 20 years of living there.</li>
<li>From the collection “Selling Manhattan”</li>
<li>The collection talks about the place/significance money has in the lives of of people, materialism and the mercenary nature of people</li>
<li>Set in the U.S.A</li>
<li>4 stanzas, 5 lines each (4 sets of quintets)</li>
<li>Sordid tale of an immigrant</li>
<li>Almost all the lines are uniform in length, could possibly suggest the uniformity of suffering</li>
<li>The use of imperatives (like “imagine”), and addressing the reader using the 2nd person pronoun, used to universalize the experience of an immigrant</li>
<li>Simple language shows the limited vocabulary of the persona</li>
<li>Caesuras and enjambments are used to show flow in thought and important pauses.</li>
<li>The repeated use of “Imagine” asks the reader to empathize with the immigrants. Feature of a dramatic monologue.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine living in a strange, dark city for twenty years.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Imperative statement, involves the reader more in the poem</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There are some dismal dwellings on the east side</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dismal dwellings: Not even houses – poverty – not well structured</li>
<li>East side: Poorer areas of the city</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>and one of them is yours. On the landing, you hear</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>2nd person pronoun- to create a sense of familiarity</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>your foreign accent echo down the stairs. You think</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Consciousness of foreign nature</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>in a language of your own and talk in theirs.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Even after 20 years, the immigrants still struggle to fit in the new culture</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Then you are writing home. The voice in your head<br>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Original language of the persona</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the sound of your mother singing to you,</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>nostalgic</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>All that time ago, and now you do not know<br>
Why your eyes are watering and what’s the word for this.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>home-sickness, lack of acculturation (the loss of the ability to retain his/her cultural identity</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>You use the public transport. Work. Sleep. Imagine one night</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>short sentences show how mundane the life of the immigrant is.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You saw a name for yourself sprayed in red<br>
against a brick wall. A hate name. Red like blood.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Exclusion from society</li>
<li>Shows the intensity of the passion the immigrants are treated with.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It is snowing in the streets, under the neon lights,<br>
as if this place were coming to bits before your eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Not used to the snow as the immigrant feels like the place is “coming to bits”</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>And in the delicatessen, from time to time, the coins</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>delicatessen: bakery</li>
<li>sometimes the money is not enough to buy food or “translate” into food</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>in your palm will not translate. Inarticulate,</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>limited vocabulary of the immigrant and therefore emphasizes on the alienation of the immigrant from the general society</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>because this is not home, you point at the fruit. Imagine</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>where you know the word for the fruit in your own language but not in theirs</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>that one of you says, <em>Me not know what these people mean.</em><br>
*It like they only go to bed and dream.*Imagine that.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>poor vocabulary of the immigrant shows the unfamiliarity to the new language</li>
