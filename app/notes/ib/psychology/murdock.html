<h2 id="aim">Aim:</h2>
<ul>
<li>To find a trend in how people remembered a set of words</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="procedure">Procedure:</h2>
<p>Participants are asked to learn a list of words that varied from 10 â€“ 40 words.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each word is presented for 2 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="results">Results:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Probability of recalling word depended on its position</li>
<li>Words either early or at the end were recalled more often (known as serial position effect)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Words early in the list were put into Long-Term Memory (primacy effect) as person can rehearse the words acoustically</li>
<li>Words from the end are put into Short-Term Memory</li>
<li>Words in the middle of the list had been there too long to be held in Short-Term Memory  and not long enough to be transferred to Long-Term Memory</li>
<li><strong>TL;DR</strong> People are recalling information from 2 stores</li>
</ul>
