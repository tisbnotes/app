<h3 id="heuristics">Heuristics:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>heuristic</strong> is a mental shortcut that allows people to solve problems and make judgments quickly and efficiently.</li>
<li>Heuristics lead to <strong>Cognitive Bias</strong>, therefore system 1 of thinking leads to <strong>Cognitive Bias</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kahneman and Tversky’s Hospital Study is an example of how people employ heuristics to come to conclusions</strong></p>
<p>People were asked the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The probability that a boy is born at any given point of time is 50%. Given that 15 babies are born in a small hospital per day and 45 babies are born in the larger hospital everyday, which hospital was more likely to record more days where the number of boys born is more than 60%*<br>
<strong>A.</strong> Larger hospital<br>
<strong>B.</strong> Smaller hospital<br>
<strong>C.</strong> Roughly the same</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>78% of the participants picked option C because of the 50% representative heuristic given in the beginning of the question.</li>
<li>The correct answer would be option B - smaller hospital, because in a larger hospital has a larger sample size and is less likely to have disproportionate day.</li>
<li>The participants were using <strong>representative heuristic</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This study demonstrates how using one system of thinking can influence our decisions.</li>
<li>It is a simple demonstration, but it fails to explain how people would react if they had consequences.</li>

<ul>
<li>The tendency to focus on limited information.</li>
<li>The tendency to look for information that confirms pre-existing beliefs.</li>
