<h2 id="aim">Aim</h2>
<ul>
<li>To Investigate the effect of context on comprehension and memory of text passages.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A prerecorded passage was played to the participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they were to recall it as accurately as possible</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="five-conditions">Five conditions:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They heard the passage once</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They heard the passage twice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people were provided a context picture before the passage was played (30 seconds)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people were provided a context picture after they heard the passage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Context pic before the passage, but objects were rearranged</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-results">The Results:</h2>
<p>The recollection of the sample was measured in <strong>idea units</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Without context = 3.6 IU</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without context x 2 = 3.8 IU</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Context before = 8 IU</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Context after = 3.6 IU</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partial context = 4 IU</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>People who were shown context before were able to recollect the most of the data in the passage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Showing the context prior to the playing of the passage influences the people to organize their knowledge according to the picture/context <em>(schema)</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Application:</strong> Contextualizing something before studying</p>
