      <h1 id="schema-theory">Schema Theory</h1>
<ul>
<li>A scheme is a <strong>mental representation</strong> that enables us to <strong>organize</strong> our knowledge into categories.</li>
<li>Our schemas help us simpliy out interaction with the world. They are mental shortcuts that can both help us and hurt us.</li>
<li>We use our schemas to learn and think about more quickly. However, some of out schemas may also be stereotypes that cause us to misinterpret or incorrectly recall information.</li>
<li>There are many types of schemas, including object, person, social, event, role and self-schemas.</li>
<li>Schemas are modified as we gain more information. This process can occur through assimilation or accommodation</li>
</ul>

<tr>
<td>Role Schemas</td>
<td>Are about proper behavious in given situations</td>

<tr>
<td>Self Schemas</td>
<td>Are about oneself. We also hold idealized or projected selves or possible selves. Expectations about the self that organize and guide the processing of self-relevant information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Person Schemas</td>
<td>It is about individual people. Expections based on personality traits. What we associate with a certain typer of person.</td>

<tr>
<td>Event Schemas</td>
<td>Are about what happened in specific situations. Expectations about sequences of events in social situations</td>

<h4 id="aim">Aim</h4>
<ul>
<li>To Investigate the effect of context on comprehension and memory of text passages</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="procedure">Procedure</h4>
<ul>
<li>A prerecorded passage was played to the participants.</li>
<li>they were to recall it as accurately as possible</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="five-conditions">Five conditions:</h4>
<ol>
<li>They heard the passage once</li>
<li>They heard the passage twice</li>
<li>The people were provided a context picture before the passage was played (30 seconds)</li>
<li>The people were provided a context picture after they heard the passage</li>
<li>Context pic before the passage, but objects were rearranged</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="the-results">The Results:</h4>
<p>The recollection of the sample was measured in <strong>idea units</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Without context = 3.6 IU</li>
<li>Without context x 2 = 3.8 IU</li>
<li>Context before = 8 IU</li>
<li>Context after = 3.6 IU</li>
<li>Partial context = 4 IU</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<ul>
<li>People who were shown context before were able to recollect the most of the data in the passage.</li>
<li>Showing the context prior to the playing of the passage influences the people to organize their knowledge according to the picture/context <em>(schema)</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="anderson-and-pichert-1978">Anderson and Pichert (1978)</h3>
<h4 id="procedure-1">Procedure</h4>
<ol>
<li>People are told that the study concerns “how people think about and remember stories”</li>
<li>The participants are assigned one of two roles; Homebuyer or Burglar</li>
<li>The participants are asked to read a passage of 373 words. They are given two minutes to do so.</li>
<li>There is a vocabulary test for 12 minutes that serves as a filler.</li>
<li>Two blank pages are handed out and the participants are asked to recall their perspective in the story as accurately as possible.</li>
<li>Participants have another filler task, but this time it is five minutes long.</li>
<li>Participants have the choice to change perspectives or keep the same perspective.</li>
<li>They are asked to recall the passage again.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="the-results-1">The Results:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The people remembered more about their own roles in the first recollection trial.</li>
<li>People who changed perspective recalled an additional 7.1% information on the other perspective.</li>
<li>People who didn’t change their perspective recalled 2.9% less.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Schemas organize the knowledge in our memory. New information is perceived through existing schemas. They even act when we are storing and recollecting information from Long Term Memory.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="types-of-processing">Types of processing</h2>
<h3 id="bottom-up-processing">Bottom-up processing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bottom-up processing refers to processing sensory information as it is coming in.
<ul>
<li>Occurs when the cognitive process is data-driven</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Top-down processing sensory information as it is coming in.
<ul>
<li>Occurs when you prior knowledge or expections act as a lens or a filter for the information that you receive and process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Studies that can be used when answering schema related questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bransford and Johnson (1972)</li>
<li>Anderson and Pichert (1978)</li>
<li>Bartlett (1932) - War of Ghosts</li>
