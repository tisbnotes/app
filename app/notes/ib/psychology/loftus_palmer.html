<h2 id="aim">Aim</h2>
<ul>
<li>To test their hypothesis that the language used in eye witness testimony can alter memory</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="experiment-one">Experiment One</h2>
<h3 id="procedure">Procedure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Forty five American students formed and Opportunity sample</li>
<li>7 files of traffic accidents, ranging in duration from 5 to 30 seconds were presented in a random order to each group.</li>
<li>Participants were asked to describe what happened as if they were eyewitness.</li>
<li>They were asked how fast the cars were going when they <strong>(smashed/collided/bumped/hit/contacted)</strong> each other.</li>
<li><em>Note: IV was the wording of the question, DV was the speed reported by participants</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<ul>
<li>The estimated speed was affected by the verb used.</li>
</ul>

</table><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>The results show that the verb conveyed an impression of the speed the car was travelling and this altered the participants’ perceptions. In other words, eyewitness testimony might be biased by the way questions are asked after a crime is committed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="experiment-two">Experiment Two</h2>
<h3 id="procedure-1">Procedure</h3>
<ul>
<li>150 Students were shown a one minute film which showed a car driving followed by four seconds of multiple traffic accidents.</li>
<li>100 students were asked <em>“how fast were the car going when they <strong>hit</strong> each other?”</em> or <em>“how fast were the car going when they <strong>smashed</strong> each other?”</em></li>
<li>Remaining 50 weren’t asked anything.</li>
<li>One week later they were asked if they saw broken glass</li>
</ul>

</table><h3 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This research suggests that memory is easily distorted by questioning technique and information acquired after the event can merge with original memory causing inaccurate recall or reconstructive memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The results from experiment two suggest that this effect is not just due to a response-bias because leading questions actually altered the memory a participant had for the event.</p>
