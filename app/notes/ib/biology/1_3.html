<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is made up of a phospholipid bilayer</li>
<li>Each molecule has a polar phoshate head and 2 non-polar long lipid<br>
tails
<ul>
<li>The head is hydrophilic <em>(attracted to water)</em></li>
<li>The tails are hydrophobic <em>(repelled by water)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is an example of an amphipathic molecule <em>(a molecule with both polar and non-polar molecules)</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="davidson-danielli-model">Davidson-Danielli Model</h2>
<ul>
<li>The membrane is a protein-lipid sandwich.</li>
<li>Lipid bilayer composed of phospholipids.</li>
<li>Proteins coat outer surface.</li>
<li>Proteins don’t permeate the lipid bilayer.
<ul>
<li><u>Evidence:</u> Light and dark layers were visible as distinct lines with an electron microscope.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-the-davidson-danielli-model-was-disproved">How the Davidson-Danielli Model was disproved</h2>
<p><strong>1) Biochemical Technique</strong> <sub>(permeability of proteins)</sub></p>
<ul>
<li>Membrane proteins were found to be varied in size and globular in shape.</li>
<li>Such proteins would be unable to form continuous layers on the periphery of the membranes.</li>
<li>Proteins were also hydrophobic in certain places, so they would be attracted to tails in the centre of the layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2) Freeze Fracturing</strong>  <sub>(permeability of proteins)</sub></p>
<ul>
<li>The cells were rapidly frozen then fractured</li>
<li>Lines of fracture occured on lines of weakness, including the centre of membranes</li>
<li>Fractures revealed a irregular rough surface and globuar structures inside the bilayer</li>
<li>These were interpreted as trans-membrane proteins</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3) Fluorescent Antibody Tagging</strong>  <sub>(mobility of proteins)</sub></p>
<ul>
<li>Red and Green fluorescent markers were attached to antibodies which would bind to membrane proteins</li>
<li>So the membrane proteins of some cells were tagged with red and other cells with green</li>
<li>The cells were fused</li>
<li>Within 40 minutes, the red and green markers were mixed throughout the fused cell</li>
</ul>
<p>This research gave rise to the Singer-Nicholson Model</p>
<h2 id="singer-nicholson-fluid-mosaic-model">Singer-Nicholson Fluid Mosaic Model</h2>
<ul>
<li>Phospholipids form a bilayer
<ul>
<li>Phospholipids and proteins are fluid and move laterally</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Peripheral proteins are bound to either the inner or outer surface of the membrane</li>
<li>Integral proteins permeate the surface of the membrane</li>
<li>The membrane is a fluid mosaic of phospholipids and proteins</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="glycoprotein-type-of-integral-protein">Glycoprotein: <em>(type of integral protein)</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>Proteins with an oligosaccharide chain attached (8-10 sugar chain)</li>
<li>Important for recognition by immune system and as hormone receptors</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cholestrol">Cholestrol</h3>
<ul>
<li>Steroid lipid that makes the phospholipids pack more tightly   and regulates the flexibility and fluidity of the membrane</li>
<li>Restricts molecular motion</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="membrane-fluidity">Membrane fluidity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Needs to be fluid enough for the cell to move</li>
<li>Needs to be fluid enough so that the required substances can pass through the cell membrane</li>
<li>If too fluid, they wouldn’t be able to control the passage of substances</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cholestrols-role-in-membrane-fluidity">Cholestrol’s role in membrane fluidity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Resctricts the movement of phospholipids
<ul>
<li>so fluidity decreases</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cholestrol disrupts the regular packing of hydrocarbon tails of phospholipid molecules
<ul>
<li>increases flexibility as it prevents tails from crystallising and behaving like a solid</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduces permeability to hydrophillic/water soluble molecules and ions such as sodium and hydrogen</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="membrane-proteins">Membrane Proteins</h2>
<h3 id="functions-of-membrane-proteins">Functions of membrane proteins:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hormone binding sites (hormone receptors) (Eg: insulin receptor)</li>
<li>Immobilized enzymes with active site on the outside (Eg: in small intestine)</li>
<li>Cell adhesion to form tight junctions between groups of cells in tissues and organs</li>
<li>Cell-to-cell communication (Eg: receptors for neurotransmitters at synapses)</li>
<li>Channels for passive transport to allow hydrophillic particles across by facilitated diffusion</li>
<li>Pumps for active transport which use ATP to move particles across membrane</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="groups-of-proteins">2 groups of proteins:</h3>
<ol>
<li><u>Integral Protein</u>:
<ul>
<li>Hydrophobic on at least one part of their surface
<ul>
<li>Therefore embedded in the hydrocarbon chains in the centre of the membrane</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many are transmembrane (extend across membrane), with hydrophillic parts projecting through the regions of phosphate heads</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><u>Peripheral Protein</u>:
<ul>
<li>Hydrophillic on their surface,
<ul>
<li>So not embedded in membrane</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most are attached to integral proteins - this attachment is often reversible.</li>
<li>Some have a single hydrocarbon chain attached that is inserted into membrane surface to anchor the protein</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="membrane-structure-1">Membrane structure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Membranes have inner and outer face, proteins must be oriented so they can perform function correctly<br>
-For example: pumps on root hair are oriented so they can pick up potassium ions from outside the cell</li>
<li>The fat and protein content in a membrane is variable, because funtions of membranes vary. More active membrane = more protein
<ul>
<li>Myelin Sheath is for insulation so low protein (18%) high fat</li>
<li>Chloroplasts and mitochondria are active in photosynthesis and respiration so high protein (75%) low fat</li>
<li>Plasma membranes surrounding cell have about 50% protein</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Draw 4-5 circles for phosphate heads</li>
<li>Then draw 2 curved tails per head</li>
<li>Repeat for opposite row</li>
<li>Draw two cylinders jutting out from both sides of the membrane (this is the channel protein)</li>
<li>Then add more phoshpholipids</li>
<li>Then add a partially-permeating glob (Peripheral Protein)</li>
<li>Add cholestrol (small circles with a line connecting to the head)
<ul>
<li>The lipid tails should bend away from the cholestrol</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Draw a large glob jutting out from both sides of the membrane, with an oligosaccharide towards the extracellular space (Integral/Glycoprotein)</li>
<li>Label with straight lines</li>
<li>Underline the words “Phospholipid Bilayer”</li>
