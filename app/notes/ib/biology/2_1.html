<h2 id="carbon-compounds">Carbon Compounds</h2>
<ul>
<li>Carbon can form tetravalent covalent bonds - valency of 4</li>
<li>allows to form compounds with multiple elements to allow for a wide array of organic molecules</li>
<li>can form long chains that build into complex structures</li>
<li>single, double or triple bonds.</li>
<li>4 main groups of organic compounds</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen and Oxygen are always in the ratio of two H to one O, like water (therefore <em>hydrate</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Lipids:</strong> broad classification for all substances insoluble in water. Includes fats (solid at rtp) and oils (liquid at rtp).</p>
<p><strong>Proteins:</strong> composed of chains of amino acids. Amino acids are units made up of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and occasionally sulphur.</p>
<p><strong>Nucleic Acids:</strong> chains of subunits called nucleotides, made out of phosphorus, oxygen, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. There are two types: ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</p>
<h2 id="metabolism">Metabolism</h2>
<p>refers to all the different chemical reactions that occur within a cell to sustain life by transforming molecules</p>
<h3 id="anabolism">Anabolism</h3>
<p>synthesis of larger, complex molecules from smaller, simple units<br>
require energy in terms of ATP<br>
E.g: protein synthesis at ribosomes, DNA synthesis during replication, photosynthesis</p>
<h3 id="catabolism">Catabolism</h3>
<p>breaking down of larger, complex molecules to form smaller, simple units<br>
releases energy, which is sometimes captured in the form of ATP<br>
E.g. chemical digestion of food in the mouth or small intestine, cellular respiration</p>
