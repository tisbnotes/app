<ul>
<li><strong>Opportunity cost:</strong> the <strong>next best alternative</strong> that is <strong>given up</strong> when making a decision.</li>
<li><strong>Production Possibility Curve(PPC):</strong> represents all <strong>possible combinations</strong> of the <strong>maximum amounts of two goods</strong> that can be produced by an economy, given its resources and technology, when there is <strong>full employment of resources</strong> and <strong>productive efficiency</strong>. All points on the curve are known as <strong>production possibilities</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Point B and C lie <strong>on</strong> the PPC, and they can only exist when:
<ul>
<li>all resources are <strong>fully employed</strong>.</li>
<li>all resources are <strong>used efficiently</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Point lies <strong>inside</strong> the PPC, and this is because the resources are <strong>not fully employed and/or being used efficiently.</strong></li>
<li>Point D is outside the PPC and is <strong>unattainable</strong>, because:
<ul>
<li><strong>scarcity exists:</strong> the economy only has <strong>limited amount of resources</strong> and there is an <strong>opportunity</strong> <strong>cost</strong> involved in any decision to produce any good, so producing outside the PPC is <strong>impossible</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="shifts-in-ppc">Shifts in PPC:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If there is an <strong>increase in resources</strong> in an economy or an <strong>increase in efficiency</strong> of resources, the PPC <strong>shifts outward</strong>.</li>
<li>Conversely, if resources are <strong>depleted</strong> or <strong>inefficiency arises</strong> in the economy, the PPC <strong>shifts</strong> <strong>inward</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>NOTE</strong>: Any change in the <strong>employment</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>existing</strong> <strong>resources</strong> does not shift the PPC, it just moves the point <strong>inward or toward the PPC</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ppc-and-increasing-opportunity-cost">PPC and increasing opportunity cost</h3>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55687438/65832814-97e16f80-e2e6-11e9-97ee-bc76b5312a86.png" alt="diagrams 002" width="500"></p>
<ul>
<li>As you move <strong>along the PPC</strong>, the opportunity cost of producing a good <strong>increases</strong>.</li>
<li>This is because the factors of production used in producing both goods are <strong>not interchangeble</strong> and cannot be used to produce both goods. This is called <strong>specialisation of factors of production</strong>, which prevents the factors of production from being <strong>fully interchangeable</strong>.</li>
<li>Therefore, for producing <strong>each</strong> <strong>additional</strong> <strong>unit</strong> of good A, <strong>more units of Good B</strong> need to be given up, as factors of production used for producing Good B will be <strong>less suited or less specialised</strong> in producing Good A.</li>
<li>This results in a PPC that is <strong>concave</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ppc-and-constant-opportunity-cost">PPC and constant opportunity cost</h3>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55687438/65832816-ab8cd600-e2e6-11e9-9a8e-7e71fa6a00bf.png" alt="diagrams 003" width="500"></p>
<ul>
<li>Conversely, if the factors of production used in producing both goods are <strong>completely interchangeable</strong>, the opportunity cost stays <strong>constant</strong>. This means that for producing <strong>each additional unit of good A</strong>, the <strong>same amount</strong> of units of good B need to be given up.</li>
<li>This means that the factors of production used for producing both goods are <strong>equally specialised in producing both</strong>.</li>
<li>This results in a PPC that is a <strong>straight line</strong>.</li>
</ul>
