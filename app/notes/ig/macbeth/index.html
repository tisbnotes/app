<ul>
<li>Lady Macbeth invoking her evil qualities shows her masculine qualities and how she is the ‘man’ in the relationship.</li>
<li>Lady Macbeth has been portrayed as more of an evil, masculine character than a feminine one, which reverses gender roles in society at the time. This makes the scene striking, and makes Lady Macbeth stand out.</li>

</li>
<li>Macbeth
<ul>
<li>His intimate relationship with Lady Macbeth is shown by the use of phrases such as “my dearest partner of greatness” and “my dearest love”.</li>
<li>This gives another perspective on Macbeth to the audience, allowing for pathos to be created later. It shows what his partner thinks of him, as a man without strength or ambition.</li>

<ul>
<li>Lady Macbeth
<ul>
<li>Unconventionally displays stereotypical manlike qualities.
<ul>
<li>Lady Macbeth’s attitude towards regicide is casual.</li>
<li>Her views contrast against Macbeth’s very strongly</li>
<li>The audience is bewildered to witness such firmness, insensitivity and evil from a female character</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The line “These deeds must not be thought…it will make us mad” is particularly significant as it is the very reason she goes mad (dramatic irony)</li>
<li>Evil</li>
<li>Manipulative
<ul>
<li>Macbeth is not the only one who errs morally; it can be argued that Lady Macbeth has been his primary instigator, and therefore, was initially more evil than Macbeth himself.</li>
<li>This scene reveals the way she commands Macbeth and challenges his manliness, thereby manipulating him to pursue his dark ambitions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Violent</li>
<li>Has a small remnant of humanity in her soul that overwhelms her later in the play

<li>“Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood clean from my hand?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Has begun his moral descent
<ul>
<li>Macbeth expresses guilt repeatedly throughout this extract, which makes the audience understand that the moral cost of killing Duncan is far greater than the superficial kingship that he has gained.</li>
<li>“Methought I heard a voice cry, ‘Sleep no more Macbeth does murder sleep’ This is an indicator of the lasting repercussions that Macbeth will face due to regicide.</li>
<li>Macbeth’s peace of mind has been destroyed, and the seeds of insecurity and mental instability have been planted in his mind.</li>
<li>Shakespeare hints at the enduring consequences that evil acts have on one’s mental wellbeing (subtle warning to audience about the implications of regicide)</li>

<h3 id="characterisation-5">Characterisation</h3>

<li>Macbeth
<ul>
<li>Macbeth’s rich and elaborate imagery in his staged reaction to Duncan’s death reveal his insincerity, suggesting he has prepared this speech beforehand.</li>
<li>His adeptness at concealing his emotions and readiness to lie reveals the fact that he has grown more evil, this pattern is seen throughout the play. As Macbeth commits crimes, his insensitivity to them increases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Macduff
<ul>
<li>Macbeth’s intricate language contrasts with Macduff’s rage.</li>

<ul>
<li>“Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man’s act, Threatens his bloody stage” → the heavens (a positive supernatural force) is dissatisfied with mankind’s deeds, and so is causing unnatural disasters on earth. Theatrical metaphor magnifies the effect of this idea, as the play is in a theatre. Almost as if the heavens is Shakespeare himself, as he controls the characters.</li>
<li>That darkness…entomb when living light should kiss it? → darkness covers earth despite being day; influence of supernatural factors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Personification
<ul>
<li>Dark night strangles the travelling lamp → periphrasis for sun; night symbolizes evil; sun symbolizes light</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ambiguity
<ul>
<li>Is’t night’s predominance…light should kiss it? → rhetorical question is purposely ambiguous to test where the Old Man’s sympathies lie; is it the overpower of (symbolically) evil, or the death of Duncan, that has resulted in this unnatural darkness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Symbolism
<ul>
<li>A falcon…mousing owl hawked at and killed → falcons are superior birds of prey (Duncan is at a higher position in the hierarchical structure of their society) and is surprisingly killed by a mousing owl, generally considered to be docile and harmless (like Macbeth’s character in the mind of Duncan)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Animal imagery
<ul>
<li>falcon, mousing owl, Duncan’s horses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Epithets
<ul>
<li>Good Macduff → first mention of the antagonist is accompanied by a positive adjective, which prejudices the audience; foreshows his important role in the play</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clothing imagery
<ul>
<li>Adieu, lest our old robes sit easier than our new → Gives the audience a sense that Macbeth’s reign has almost been forcefully imposed on them; old robes = Duncan; new robes = Macbeth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Antithetical words, rhyming couplet
<ul>
<li>God’s benison…friends of foes → shows Old Man’s favourable disposition towards Malcolm, and therefore further prejudices the audience</li>
<li>Antithesis in the phrases good of bad; friends of foes</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="general-overview-2">General Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li>Time lapse between the last scene and this one; degradation in Macbeth’s character is plainly evident</li>
<li>There is tension between the characters of Macbeth and Banquo - Banquo suspects Macbeth’s intentions (“I fear Thou played’st most foully for’t”). Macbeth also asks questions about Banquo’s departure “Ride you this afternoon?”, “Goes Fleance with you?”. He also plots Banquo’s murder in this scene.</li>
<li>Macbeth speaks to the murders in prose, rather than in verse, showing that he has stooped down to their level.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="devices-5">Devices</h3>

<li>His royalty of nature… be feared → Banquo is the ruler of good virtues, which is why Macbeth fears him (slightly ironical in that sense; good qualities are generally not feared)</li>
<li>Put rancours in my vessel of peace only for them→ put poison in his mind; Macbeth is aware that his actions have had a repercussions on his mental wellbeing</li>
<li>With barefaced power…sight → hyperbole; super subtle flex to murders about his power as king</li>

<li>Allusion
<ul>
<li>My genius was rebuked as Mark Antony was by Caesar → Caesar was more respected due to nobility and character</li>
<li>Mine eternal jewel…common enemy of men → christian belief that soul is most precious commodity; by committing sin of murder he has given his soul to Satan; shows awareness that his actions are not good; tragic hero</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Metonymy
<ul>
<li>Placed a fruitless crown…barren sceptre → Macbeth is bitter that his kingship will not be passed on to is sons (according to the prophecies)</li>
<li>Heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave…forever → Banquo’s power and influence has (metaphorically) killed and impoverished their families</li>
</ul>

<li>Simile
<ul>
<li>“Then prophet-like, they hailed him father to a line of kings” → compares the witches to prophets, religious leaders. This shows that Macbeth now attributes heavenly qualities to the witches, and that they no longer seem evil from his moral perspective</li>

Characters</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Banquo
<ul>
<li>Shakespeare purposely leaves his character as ambiguous in his last soliloquy in the play</li>
<li>Slight streak of greed is clearly visible in the hypophora May they not be my oracles as well?</li>
<li>Change in power dynamics; scared to say his thought out loud. Seen in the line But hush, no more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Macbeth
<ul>
<li>Degradation in character is clearly seen through his soliloquy which parallels the one he delivered in Act 1 Scene 7. However, here we can see Macbeth solely justifying the reason for murder, without contemplating the ethical and moral implications.</li>
<li>Macbeth’s insensitivity is also not limited to murder; he does not refrain from insulting and manipulating even the murderers by challenging their masculinity - hmm. Where have we seen this trick before? Macbeth’s actions mirror Lady Macbeth’s, showing the audience that he has now become capable of acts like manipulation.</li>
<li>The fact that Macbeth does not commit the murder himself emphasizes his degeneration as it reveals his ruthlessness</li>
<li>It is important to note that he does not ask for his wife’s guidance and help; seems to be perfectly moulded into the role/person he is supposed to be and Lady Macbeth wanted him to be → an ambitious man who will go to any means to secure his position</li>
<li>Macbeth “To be thus is nothing but to be safely thus”. He is utterly discontent with his situation. “Fruitless crown, barren sceptre” → Macbeth’s insecurity is further revealed when he plots Banquo’s murder. He wants to leave no loose ends in his evil and ambitious endeavours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scene-2-2">Scene 2</h2>
<h3 id="general-overview-3">General Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li>This scene marks a shift in the relationship between Macbeth and LMB. Both of them are halfway through their evolution, and are knee-deep in emotional turmoil. They “ eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake [them] nightly”. This shows how insecure they are.</li>
<li>The distance in their relationship is clearly visible. We can see this in the line “I would attend his leisure for a few words” (She has to ask for permission to meet her own husband) ; “why do you keep alone”</li>
<li>We cannot say their relationship itself is deteriorating as their love for eachother is yet apparent. Evidence can be found in the phrases “dearest chuck” and “dear wife”</li>

<ul>
<li>Macbeth
<ul>
<li>Macbeth is no longer “full o’ the milk of human kindness”. He has embarked on the dangerous, bloody journey to make his throne secure.</li>
<li>Macbeth envies Duncan. Fate has given him a quick departure from life, whereas Macbeth is suffering. “Duncan is in his grave. After life’s fitful fever, he sleeps well”.</li>
<li>There is a reversal in power at this point - Macbeth has now taken his fate into his own hands, and advices Lady Macbeth, instead of it being the other way round, as it was initially. This is evidenced in the phrase “Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, Till thou applaud the deed”.</li>
<li>Macbeth indulges in images and ideas that are unbecoming of a king; he wishes death and destruction upon his kingdom for his sake; selfish</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lady Macbeth
<ul>
<li>Does not have peace of mind - “doubtful joy”. She is deeply troubled by what she and Macbeth committed, while she isn’t able to enjoy being Queen.</li>
<li>She is in so much fear and is drowning in insecurity - “‘Tis safer to be that which we destroy”.</li>
<li>While she gained queenship, she feels empty - “nought’s had, all’s spent”.</li>
<li>She is suffering, yet hypocritically gives Macbeth advice - “Things without all remedy should be without regard”. This shows that she reverts back to her role of being a spur, an enabler of evil, even though she is emotionally unstable.</li>
<li>First glimpse the audience is provided to see beyond</li>

<ul>
<li>Metaphor
<ul>
<li>We have scotch’d the snake, not kill’d it<br>
She’ll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice<br>
Remains in danger of her former tooth.” → The snake is a metaphor for the danger that they are in. This is ironic, as Macbeth himself is the creator of this snake he was respected and loved before ambition corrupted his intent.</li>
<li>After life’s …sleeps well → compares life to disease; constant struggle now at peace; sense of envy</li>
<li>O full of…dear wife! → sudden interjection shows it is bothering him considerably; love and trust</li>
<li>Must lave our…flattering streams → make sure everyone is pleased; appearance vs reality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Oxymoron
<ul>
<li>“Restless ecstasy” → Macbeth’s longing for ‘ecstasy’, which he thought he would get when he obtains the position of King, is filled with doubt, guilt, and fits of insecurity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rhyming couplet
<ul>
<li>‘Tis safer to be that…doubtful joy → oxymoron; she remarks that it would be better to be dead than to live unhappily</li>

<li>Animal imagery + symbolism
<ul>
<li>“The shard-borne beetle”, “ere the bat hath flown”, “full of scorpions is my mind”, “the crow which makes wing to th’rocky wood”</li>
<li>These animals are symbolize darkness and malice, which creates an eerie, sinister atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Personification + symbolism
<ul>
<li>“Come, seeling night, Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day” → Macbeth invokes the night to conceal his evil actions. This is seen in Scotland itself, as Macbeth’s reign results in evil spreading across his land. Evil has overtaken kindness, just like night enshrouds day. (animal imagery of Falconry)</li>
<li>Treason has done…further → synecdoche (steel = sword); sense of jealousy that usual threats to king no longer worry him;</li>

<h3 id="characterisation-8">Characterisation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Macbeth
<ul>
<li>Mentally unstable</li>
<li>Macbeth’s mental projection of Banquo represents the threat Banquo still poses for Macbeth with his line of descendants (“Fleance is ‘scaped”). It is a manifestation of his guilt and insecurity. “This is the very painting of your fear This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said, Led you to Duncan.”</li>
<li>Insecure “now I am cabin’d, cribb’d, confined, bound in to saucy doubts and fears”</li>
<li>Macbeth rapidly shifts between greeting his kinsmen and vilely expressing his frustration. This shows that he is unable to handle the responsibilities of being King while scheming to protect his position. This is ironic, as he is neglecting his duty as King just for the sake of being King longer. This shows his inherent folly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lady Macbeth
<ul>
<li>This scene being the last appearance of Lady Macbeth reflects the fact that she has become unimportant to Macbeth after this point, a meaningless irrelevancy.</li>
<li>She challenges Macbeth’s manliness yet again, but Macbeth responds with equal tenacity due to the rage and frustration he is in.</li>

<li>Consolidates her status as a tragic heroine</li>
<li>The Elizabethan (did not understand mental illnesses) and modern responses are starkly different; the former believe a sense a divine justice has been reached whereas the latter feel pity and sympathy<br>
Language</li>
<li>Regular rhythm and verse is missing as it is not appropriate for someone who has lost her mind</li>
<li>Almost as if she is denied the dignity and sublimation associated with poetic language</li>

<ul>
<li>Macbeth
<ul>
<li>Lady Macbeth’s death propels Macbeth into a deeply contemplative state where he questions his life and existence, having lost her. This shows his love for her</li>
<li>Macbeth has lost all sensitivity in his life he does not fear anymore. His emotionless mind is the result of all of the horrors that he has experienced. He is tired of life itself.
<ul>
<li>“I have almost forgot the taste of fears”</li>
<li>“my senses would have cool’d to hear a night-shriek”</li>
<li>“Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts cannot once start me.”</li>
<li>“She should have died hereafter”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Macbeth’s elevated language seems to be returning to the level of the previous of Acts, shows that he is still inherently the same man.</li>
<li>Macbeth realises his folly and comes to a revelation at the end of the play. He reflects on the futility of life in the lines “It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing”. His nihilistic views are the product of his sorrow at Lady Macbeth’s death, as well as the hopeless situation he finds himself trapped in. He remarks “Out, out, brief candle, life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more.” This reflects his realisation about the inevitability of death, while comparing life to an actor that is temporarily in the spotlight and then is heard from no more. This theatrical imagery is powerful in the context of a theatre. This evokes pathos in Macbeth and his situation, because his grief and misery is expressed vividly through these lines. He realises the folly in his actions, and truly understands their consequences now when he is suffering. In this way, Macbeth can be argued to have reached clarity about the reality of life, by enduring the consequences of his folly, which is his downfall.</li>
