<h2 id="definitions-1">Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demand for labour</strong> is the number of workers firms are willing and able to employ at a given wage rate.</li>
<li><strong>Derived demand</strong> means the demand for labour is not demanded for itself but for the goods and services labour is used to produce.</li>
<li>The <strong>equilibrium wage rate</strong> is determined when the wage rate workers are willing to work for equals the wage rate that firms are prepared to pay.</li>
<li><strong>Geographical mobility</strong> occurs when a person is prepared to relocate to another area for a job.</li>
<li>The <strong>labour force participation rate</strong> is the percentage of the working population that is working .</li>
<li><strong>Labour supply</strong> consists of people who are of working age and are willing and able to work at prevailing wage rates.</li>
<li>A <strong>national minimum wage</strong> is the lowest amount a firm can pay its workers and is set bythe government.</li>
<li><strong>Occupational mobility</strong> is when a person can easily move from one type of job to another.</li>
<li>A <strong>salary</strong> is a fixed monthly payment in return for labour services.</li>
<li><strong>Specialisation of labour</strong> occurs when a worker becomes an expert in a particular profession or in a part of a production process.</li>
<li>A <strong>wage</strong> is the return for labour services, paid hourly or weekly. Payment depends on the amount of time worked.</li>

<li>Amount of experience accrued</li>
<li>Amount of time worked at a certain firm</li>
<li>Wages are constant after the individual reaches the peak of their career</li>

<h2 id="wage-determination">Wage determination</h2>
<h3 id="demand-for-labour">Demand for labour</h3>
<ul>
<li>Factors influencing demand for labour:
<ol>
<li>Aggregate demand in the economy</li>
<li>Increase in productivity of labour</li>
<li>Cost of labour compared with cost of machinery that could replace it</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The labour supply in an economy consists of people who are of working age and who are willing and able to work.</li>
<li>It can be backward bending as well.</li>
<li>Factors affecting supply of labour:
<ol>
<li>Labour force participation rate</li>
<li>Availability and level of welfare benefits</li>
<li>Changing social climate</li>
<li>Geographical mobility</li>
<li>Occupational mobility</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="national-minimum-wage">National minimum wage</h3>
<ul>
<li>A national minimum wage ( NMW ) is the lowest amount a firm can pay its workers, as set by the government.</li>
<li>Advantages
<ol>
<li>Workers receive a fair wage and are not exploited</li>
<li>Unemployed people have an incentive to work</li>
<li>Low-income earners have more money to spend, increasing aggregate demand in the economy</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Disadvantages
<ol>
<li>Increase in the cost of labour for firms, as workers earning higher than minimum might request the firms to raise their wages to maintain a high differential between them and less-skilled workers.</li>
<li>Unemployment may increase as firms’ cost of labour increases, causing them to be able to hire less people.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="differences-in-earnings">Differences in earnings</h2>
<ol>
<li>Skilled workers earn more than unskilled workers due to relativity higher demand and relatively lower supply</li>
<li>Male workers earn more than female workers because they do not need to tend after children, but times are a-changing.</li>
<li>In theory, private sector workers can earn more than public sector workers, because of the profit maximisation incentive in private sector firms.</li>
<li>Private sector jobs are less secure than the public sector jobs. The workers in private sector jobs often have to save up for their own pensions in retirement.</li>
<li>The tertiary sector occupations promise more in terms of wage than the other sectors.</li>
<li>The supply of labour of people with special talents or celebrity status is <strong>price inelastic</strong>. There are very limited number of people with these talents so the wage rate will be very high because of the downward sloping demand curve.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="government-interference-in-a-labour-market">Government interference in a labour market</h2>
<ol>
<li>Employment rights; protect employees from discrimination.</li>
<li>Trade union legislation; governments can reduce the powers of trade unions to make the labour market more efficient.</li>

<li>Workers in low-skilled work may become alienated</li>
<li>The production process may become overdependent on a specific individual</li>
<li>The workers become deskilled in other areas and lose flexibility</li>
