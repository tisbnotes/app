<h1 id="standards-of-living">Standards of living</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard of living</strong> refers to the social and economic wellbeing of individuals in a country at a point in time.</li>
<li>Indicators of standards of living:
<ul>
<li>GDP per capita</li>
<li>The cost of living</li>
<li>Material wealth</li>
<li>Health indicators</li>
<li>Education indicators</li>
<li>Social and environmental indicators</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<ul>
<li>Low and middle income countries are called “developing countries” or <strong>less economically developed countries (LEDC)s.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Characteristics
<ol>
<li>Low GDP per capita</li>
<li>Low life expectancy</li>
<li>Low literacy rates</li>
<li>High population growth</li>
<li>Poor infrastructure</li>
<li>Low foreign direct investment</li>
<li>Poor health care</li>
<li>Low labour productivity</li>
<li>High public debt (money owed by the government)</li>
<li>Reliance on primary sector output</li>
<li>Corruption</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>High income countries are called “developed countries” or <strong>more economically developed countries (MEDC)s.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="poverty">Poverty</h2>
<ul>
<li>Poverty is a condition that exists when people lack adequate income and wealth to sustain a basic standard of living.
<ul>
<li>Hunger and malnutrition</li>
<li>Ill health and mortality from illness</li>
<li>Limited or lack of access to education and other basic services</li>
<li>Homelessness and inadequate housing</li>
<li>Unsafe environments</li>
<li>Social discrimination and exclusion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Absolute poverty
<ul>
<li>Exists when there is extreme, outright poverty.</li>
<li>Poverty in absolute poverty are undeniably poor.</li>
<li>Income, if any, is spent on minimal basic human needs for survival.</li>
<li>To measure, the number of individuals living below a certain level of income called the <strong>poverty line</strong> is calculated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relative poverty
<ul>
<li>This is a <strong>comparative measure</strong>, rather than an absolute measure, of poverty.</li>
<li>These people have a lower standard of living in comparison with the average member of society.</li>
<li>Relative poverty measures the extent to which a person’s financial resources fall below that of the average income for the population.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="policies-to-alleviate-poverty">Policies to alleviate poverty</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fiscal policies
<ol>
<li>Progressive tax systems</li>
<li>Government transfer payments, ie. unemployment benefit, state pension funds, child benefit.</li>
<li>Government provision of basic services.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Monetary policies
<ol>
<li>Low interest rates to encourage borrowing</li>
<li>Low exchange rates for greater export sales</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Supply side policies
<ol>
<li>Policies to reduce unemployment</li>
<li>Policies to increase the quantity and quality of education</li>
<li>Sustained economic growth</li>
<li>Labour market reforms</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Foreign aid
<ol>
<li>Bilateral foreign aid: assistance from one government to the other</li>
<li>Multilateral foreign aid: official financial assistance from more than one source</li>
<li>Development aid: official financial assistance from governments and agencies to fund the economic development of a country</li>
<li>Humanitarian aid: philanthropic financial assistance for saving lives and maintaining human dignity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1 id="population">Population</h1>
<ul>
<li>Factors that affect population growth
<ol>
<li>Birth rate</li>
<li>Death rate</li>
<li>Fertility rate</li>
<li>Net migration rate</li>
<li>Life expectancy</li>
<li>Social changes</li>
<li>Natural disasters, diseases, and war</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="population-distribution">Population distribution</h2>
<ul>
<li>Gender
<ul>
<li>Normally, gender split is even.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Age distribution
<ul>
<li>LEDCs
<ul>
<li>Relatively large proportion of population in the younger age groups</li>
<li>Population rapidly decreases as age increases</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MEDCs
<ul>
<li>Ageing population</li>
<li>Growing number of elderly people</li>
<li>Population highest at the middle ages</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dependency ratio
<ul>
<li>Dependency ratio = dependent population ÷ working population</li>
<li>Higher the dependency ration, the greater the tax burden on the working population to support those who are not economically active.</li>
<li>Causes of a high dependency ratio:
<ol>
<li>High birth rates, mainly in LEDCs</li>
<li>Higher compulsory school leaving age, keeping students dependent for longer</li>
<li>Social changes such as demand for higher education or more people choosing early retirement</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-optimum-population">The optimum population</h2>
<ul>
<li>The optimum population exists when the output of goods and services per head (GDP per capita) of the population is maximised.</li>
<li>A country is <strong>under populated</strong> if it does not have sufficient labour to make the best use of its resources.</li>
<li>A country is <strong>over populated</strong> if the population is too large, given the available resources of the country.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consequences-of-population-changes">Consequences of population changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>As a country develops, there is a shift away from reliance on primary and secondary sector production towards tertiary output.</li>
<li>As a population grows:
<ul>
<li>The demand for goods and services change with variations in population distribution.</li>
<li>The demand for, and supply of, labour will change following long-term changes in population trends.</li>
<li>A growing population brings about more benefits as the government is able to collect more tax revenues from a larger workforce.</li>
<li>There is added pressure on the government to provide more public services, welfare benefits, and state pensions.</li>
<li>More pressure is put on an economy’s scarce resources. This can lead to inflationary pressures or an increase in demand for imports.</li>
<li>Natural and non-renewable resources are depleted, and this puts strain on the natural environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
