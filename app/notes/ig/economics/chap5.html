<hr>
<h1 id="government-aims-and-influences">Government Aims and Influences</h1>
<ul>
<li>The government plays a key role as a producer of goods and services and as an employer. It provides the following goods and services to the general public:
<ol>
<li>Public Goods</li>
<li>Merit Goods</li>
<li>Public Services</li>
<li>Welfare Services</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The government influences private producers through the use of regulation, subsidies and taxation policies.
<ol>
<li><strong>Regulation</strong>. Government regulations determine the boundaries within which private producers can operate.
<ol>
<li>Employment Legislation</li>
<li>Consumer Protection Laws</li>
<li>Environmental Protection</li>
<li>Competition Law</li>
<li>Intellectual Property Rights</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Subsidies</strong> are financial assistance provided by a government to reduce the costs of production for firms. They are used to encourage output and consumption of certain goods and services.</li>
<li><strong>Tax</strong> is a levy or charge imposed by a government to raise costs of production and to reduce consumption of certain goods or services.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Governments objectives
<ol>
<li>Full Employment (low employment)
<ul>
<li><em>Unemployment</em> refers to people who are out of work, but who are of working age, are mentally and physically able to work, and are actively looking for work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Price Stability (control of inflation)
<ul>
<li><em>Inflation</em> refers to the persistent rise in the general price levels in the economy.</li>
<li>Higher inflation rates reduces the international competitiveness of a country as prices will be higher. This leads to lower export sales, which can cause potential job losses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Economic Growth</li>
<li>Redistribution of Income</li>
<li>Balance of Payments Stability
<ul>
<li>The money flowing into a country (sale of exports) is equal to the money flowing out (purchase of exports).</li>
<li>A balance of payments surplus is when the inflows exceed the outflows. This is inflationary in the long run due to the excess money entering the country.</li>
<li>A balance of payments deficit is when the outflows exceed the inflows. This is when the country has spent more than it has earned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Conflicts between government aims occur. Examples of these are:
<ol>
<li>Economic Growth vs. Low Inflation</li>
<li>Economic Growth vs. Balance of Payments Stability</li>
<li>Economic Growth vs. Environmental Protection</li>
<li>Economic Growth vs. Redistribution of Income</li>
<li>Full Employment vs. Low Inflation</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>However, it is possible for a government to achieve its macroeconomic objectives without conflicts occurring. For example, it is possible to achieve low inflation along with economic growth through the use of supply-side policies. Similarly, if economic growth is export-led, it will not lead to a deficit on the current account of the balance of payments.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1 id="government-policies">Government Policies</h1>
<h2 id="fiscal-policy">Fiscal Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s the use of taxation and government expenditure strategies to influence the level of economic activity and macroeconomic objectives.</li>
<li>If the government
<ol>
<li>Balances its revenues and its spending, then a <em>balanced budget</em> exists.</li>
<li>Spends more than it collects from its revenues then a <em>budget deficit</em> exists.</li>
<li>Earns more revenue than it spends, a <em>budget surplus</em> exists.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-of-fiscal-policy">Use of Fiscal Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Expansionary fiscal policy</em> is used to stimulate the economy by increasing government spending and/or lowering taxes.</li>
<li><em>Contractionary fiscal policy</em> is used to reduce the level of economic activity by decreasing government spending and/or raising taxes.</li>
<li>It is also used to redistribute income and wealth in the economy. High income taxes can help reallocate resources from wealthier individuals to poorer ones.</li>
<li>Impact on the supply side of the economy:
<ol>
<li>Lower income tax incentivises people to seek employment and work harder</li>
<li>Government capital expenditure on infrastructure helps to boost capital investment of firms in the economy</li>
<li>Human capital expenditure (government’s expenditure on investing in human education and training) boosts the productivity of labour.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Limitations of fiscal policy
<ul>
<li>Time delays
<ol>
<li>Recognition lags - There is a time lag in governments recognising that intervention is needed to affect the level of economic activity.</li>
<li>Administrative lags - There is a time delay between recognising that fiscal policy intervention is needed and actually implementing the appropriate action.</li>
<li>Impact lags - There is again, you guessed it, time delay between the action of implementing fiscal policy and it actually having an effect on the economy.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Conflicting macroeconomic objectives
<ul>
<li>While expansionary fiscal policy helps achieve economic growth, this can fuel demand-pull inflation.</li>
<li>While contractionary fiscal policy helps control inflationary pressures, this causes a decrease in real GDP, which can cause unemployment in the economy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="monetary-policy">Monetary Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is the manipulation if interest rates, exchange rates,  and the money supply to control the amount of spending and investment in an economy.</li>
<li>It’s hard to directly control the money supply. So, most governments rely on interest rate policy to achieve economic stability.</li>
<li>Monetary policy can be used to either expand or contract economic activity in the economy.
<ul>
<li>Expansionary monetary policy increases economic activity by lowering interest rates.</li>
<li>Contractionary monetary policy slows down economic activity by raising interest rates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>Time lags, just like fiscal policy</li>
<li>Interest rates aren’t the only thing economic activity is dependant on. Even if low interest rates are present, consumer and business confidence levels can impact GDP.</li>
<li>Some economists argue that the use of monetary policy can be counterproductive because it restricts economic activity.
<ul>
<li>It discourages foreign direct investment in the country due to high interest rates.</li>
<li>It raises the costs of production for firms</li>
<li>It can conflict with other macroeconomic objectives like economic growth and employment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="supply-side-policies">Supply Side Policies</h2>
<ul>
<li>Policies
<ol>
<li>Privatisation: The policy of selling off state-owned assets to the private sector if they can be run more efficiently.</li>
<li>Deregulation: The removal of barriers to entry, thereby making markets more competitive and more productive.</li>
<li>Capital Investment: The investment in new technologies, infrastructure and R&amp;D, contributing to the economic development of an economy.</li>
<li>Human Capital Investment: The government’s investment in human training and education improves skills of the country’s workforce, leading to lower unemployment and more labour productivity.</li>
<li>Tax Reforms: Lower taxes can create incentives for work.</li>
<li>Enterprise Zones: The government creates financial incentives for firms to relocate to areas with relatively high rates of unemployment. The incentives include tax rebates and reduced regulations.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Advantages:
<ol>
<li>Improved economic growth</li>
<li>Lower inflation</li>
<li>Lower unemployment</li>
<li>Improved balance of payments</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Disadvantage:
<ol>
<li>It takes a ton of time for supply-side policies to be implemented as well as its benefits to be reaped.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="taxation">Taxation</h1>
<p>A <strong>tax</strong> is a government levy on income or expenditure. Governments impose taxes to:<br>
* Raise government revenue<br>
* Raise the costs of production of demerit products and limit their output<br>
* Charge tariffs on the import foreign goods to encourage consumption on domestic goods.</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxes are levied in two ways:
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct</strong> - Taxes taken directly from an individual or business wealth. Examples are taxes on salaries, inheritance and company profits.</li>
<li><strong>Indirect</strong> - Taxes imposed on expenditure on goods and services. Examples are GST or VAT.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <em>tax burden</em> is the amount of tax that households and firms have to pay. This can be measured (for a country) as a proportion of its GDP.</li>
<li>The <em>tax rate</em> is the proportion of an individual’s income that is paid as taxes.</li>
<li><em>Tax avoidance</em> is the legal act of minimising payment of taxes by avoiding spending on items with a large sales tax. On the other hand, <em>tax evasion</em> is the illegal act of not paying the correct amount of tax, perhaps due to a firm under-declaring its profits.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="types-of-taxation">Types of taxation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Progressive taxation: Tax rate for an individual rises as their income rises.</li>
<li>Regressive taxation: Tax rate for an individual falls as their income rises.</li>
<li>Proportional taxation: Tax rate is constant for all individuals.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-impact-of-taxation">The impact of taxation:</h2>
<ol>
<li>The imposition of a sales tax will shift the supply curve of a product to the left due to higher costs of production.</li>
<li>Taxation reduces incentives to work and produce, so economic growth takes a hit. This also means that people are disincentivized to get richer, because of progressive taxation.</li>
<li>Taxation reduces the disposable income of individuals and firms, and so reduces inflation.</li>
<li>High corporation taxes and income taxes in a country can reduce foreign direct investment in that country.</li>
<li>Higher taxes on demerit good scan reduce their consumption.</li>
<li>High taxes encourage tax avoidance and tax evasion.</li>
<li>Progressive taxes can help reduce income inequality.</li>
