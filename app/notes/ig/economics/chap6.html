<h1 id="inflation">Inflation</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong> is a sustained rise in the general/average price level in an economy over time.</li>
<li>Governments aim to control inflation because:
<ol>
<li>It reduces the value of money, and the purchasing power of households, governments and firms.</li>
<li>Inflation reduces the international competitiveness of an economy.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Causes of inflation
<ol>
<li>Cost-push inflation: higher costs of production makes firms raise their prices in order to maintain their profit margins.</li>
<li>Demand-pull inflation: a right-shift in aggregate demand drives up the general price of goods and services.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Consequences of inflation
<ol>
<li>Menu costs</li>
<li>Decrease in purchasing power of consumers</li>
<li>Savers gain less return on saving</li>
<li>Lenders gain less return on lending</li>
<li>Borrowers have to pay a lower real interest rate</li>
<li>Fixed income earners see a fall in their real income</li>
<li>Low income earners take the largest hit</li>
<li>International competitiveness of a country falls, exports decrease</li>
<li>Importing becomes more expensive.</li>
<li>A demand for higher wages from employers increases labour costs of production for employers</li>
<li>An increase in business uncertainty and lower real rates of return on investment discourages planned investment in the economy</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deflation">Deflation</h2>
<ul>
<li>A persistent fall in the general price level of goods and services in the economy.</li>
<li>Causes of deflation
<ol>
<li>Right shift in aggregate supply  - benign deflation</li>
<li>Left shift in aggregate demand - malign deflation</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Consequences of deflation
<ol>
<li>Unemployment (malign deflation)</li>
<li>Bankruptcies (malign deflation)</li>
<li>Wealth effect (malign deflation)</li>
<li>Debt effect</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="measuring-inflation">Measuring Inflation</h2>
<h3 id="consumer-price-index">Consumer Price Index</h3>
<ul>
<li>Measures price changes in a representative basket of goods and services (those consumed by the average household) in the country.</li>
<li>Different weights are applied to each product to reflect the relative importance of each item in the average household’s expenditure. These weights are based on the proportion of the average household’s income spent on the items in the basket.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cpi-vs-rpi">CPI vs RPI</h3>
<ul>
<li>Differences:
<ul>
<li>RPI includes the cost of housing, such as mortgage interest payments and other housing costs. The RPI also includes overseas expenditure by domestic households.</li>
<li>The CPI includes costs paid for financial services, such as banks.</li>
<li>RPI excludes low-income pensioner households and very high-income households.</li>
<li>RPI is calculated using the arithmetic mean whereas the CPI uses the geometric mean.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="calculating-the-cpi-or-rpi">Calculating the CPI or RPI</h3>
<ul>
<li>A <em>base year</em> is selected, which is used as a starting period to compare change in prices with.</li>
<li>Delta CPI or Delta RPI gives the rate of inflation. Two steps are involved:
<ul>
<li>Collection of the price data on a monthly basis</li>
<li>Assigning the statistical weights, representing different patterns of spending over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The weights all add up to 1. The weighted sum of the price index of all the goods and services is the weighted index.</li>
<li>The base year is given a price index of 100.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1 id="employment">Employment</h1>
<h2 id="changing-patterns-and-levels-of-employment">Changing patterns and levels of employment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Employment refers to the use of factors of production, such as labour, in the economy.</li>
<li>Some changing patterns in modern economies include:
<ol>
<li>Employment sector</li>
<li>Delayed entry to workforce</li>
<li>Ageing population</li>
<li>Flexible working patterns</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>What employment does
<ol>
<li>Raises standards of living for the average person in the country</li>
<li>Increases economic growth</li>
<li>Raises tax revenues</li>
<li>Prevents ‘brain drain’ from the economy</li>
<li>Reduces income and wealth inequalities</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="unemployment">Unemployment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Unemployment occurs when people of working age are both willing and able to work but cannot find employment.</li>
<li>The unemployment rate is: <code>(number_of_unemployed/workforce)*100%</code></li>
<li><strong>Types</strong> of unemployment
<ul>
<li>Cyclical Unemployment: occurs during recession due to falling consumer demand &amp; incomes
<ul>
<li>Firms reduce output &amp; lay off workers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Structural Unemployment: caused by changes in industrial structure of an economy
<ul>
<li>Entire industries close due to a permanent fall in demand for their goods/services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Frictional Unemployment: refers to short-lived unemployment; e.g. moving to different job</li>
<li>Seasonal Unemployment: occurs because consumer demand for goods/services changes with seasons; e.g. no job for ski instructor when/where there is no ice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Consequences</strong> of unemployment
<ol>
<li>The unemployed suffer from stress, low self-esteem, homelessness, depression and other health problems</li>
<li>Family and dependent family members may also suffer, could lead to arguments, separation or divorce</li>
<li>Firms lose out, lower levels of consumer spending</li>
<li>Higher government expenditure on welfare benefits and healthcare for the unemployed</li>
<li>The economy is less internationally competitive because of low national spending and output</li>
<li>Taxpayers find their money used increasingly for welfare rather than other expenditure projects</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Solving unemployment</strong>
<ul>
<li>Expansionary fiscal policy</li>
<li>Expansionary monetary policy</li>
<li>Protectionist measures, import tariffs and quotas to safeguard local jobs against international competition</li>
<li>Supply-side policies
<ul>
<li>Investment in education and training</li>
<li>A reduction in trade union powers</li>
<li>Employment incentives</li>
<li>A review of welfare benefits</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="economic-growth">Economic Growth</h1>
<ul>
<li>GDP measures the monetary value of goods and services produced within a country for a given period of time, usually one year. It’s measured by the formula <code>GDP = C + I + G + (X- M)</code>, where
<ol>
<li>Consumption Expenditure © refers to the total spending on goods and services by individuals and households in an economy.</li>
<li>Investment Expenditure (I) refers to the capital expenditure of firms which is used to further production and expand the economy’s productive capacity.</li>
<li>Government Expenditure (G) refers to the total consumption and investment expenditure of the government.</li>
<li>Export Earnings (X) measures the monetary value of all exports sold to foreign buyers.</li>
<li>Import Expenditure (M) measures the monetary value of the payments made for all imports.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Economic Growth is the increase in a country’s of national output or GDP (gross domestic product) over a period of time (eg. one year).</li>
<li>Causes of economic growth:
<ol>
<li>Factor endowments. This refers to the quantity and quality of a country’s factors of production. Countries can specialise production on a large scale using these factors, benefiting from economies of scale and export their lower-priced products to overseas markets (increase X).</li>
<li>The labour force. The size, skills and mobility of the economy’s workforce has an impact on the country’s economic growth.</li>
<li>Labour productivity. This refers to the amount of goods and services that workers produce in a given time period. This is often expressed as output per worker, which is GDP/(country’s labour force). Technological advances influence labour productivity.</li>
<li>Investment expenditure. This variable (I) impacts GDP, which increases as investment expenditure increases. Investing in capital resources improves labour productivity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Advantages of economic growth
<ol>
<li>Improved standards of living. Higher levels of income enable people to spend more money to meet their needs and wants.</li>
<li>Employment. More economic growth leads to more employment. This encourages consumption, which also allows to sustain more economic growth.</li>
<li>Tax revenues. More spending (due to economic growth) increases the tax revenues received by the government. Hence, there are more funds for the government to sustain the growth of the economy.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Disadvantages of economic growth
<ol>
<li>Environmental consequences. Economic growth can create negative externalities such as pollution, congestion, climate change and land erosion.</li>
<li>Risk of inflation. If the economy grows due to excessive demand in the economy, there is the danger of demand-pull inflation.</li>
<li>Inequalities in income and wealth. Economic growth often creates greater disparities in the distribution of income and wealth.</li>
<li>Resource depletion. Economic growth often involves using up a country’s resources at rates that are not sustainable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The business cycle of an economy goes through four phases:
<ol>
<li>Boom</li>
<li>Recession</li>
<li>Slump</li>
<li>Growth/Recovery</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Measures and indicators of living standards
<ul>
<li>Human Development Index (HDI)
<ul>
<li>Uses three dimensions of human development:
<ol>
<li>Healthcare</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Income levels</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Limitations in using HDI to measure standards of living:
<ol>
<li>Qualitative factors - HDI ignores qualitative measures affecting standards of living, such as gender inequalities and human rights.</li>
<li>Income distribution - HDI does not take account of inequitable income distribution, thus being less accurate in measuring living standards for the average person.</li>
<li>Environmental issues - the HDI ignores environmental and resource depletion resulting from economic growth.</li>
<li>Cultural differences - although the HDI is a composite indicator, it ignores cultural differences and interpretations of the meaning of standards of living.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GDP per head (GDP per capita)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
