<h1 id="specialisation">Specialisation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Specialisation occurs when individuals, firms, regions or countries concentrate on the production of a particular good or service.</li>
<li>International specialisation occurs when certain countries concentrate n the production of certain goods or services due to cost advantages, perhaps due to their abundant resources.</li>
<li>Overspecialisation occurs when an individual, firm, region or country concentrates too much on producing a very limited number of goods and services. This exposes the economic agent to a far higher degree of risk.</li>
<li>Regional specialisation occurs when certain areas concentrate on the production of certain goods or services.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
<ol>
<li>Efficiency gains - makes better use of scarce resources.</li>
<li>Improved labour productivity due to more skilled labourers.</li>
<li>Increased productive capacity</li>
<li>Economies of scale</li>
<li>Improved international competitiveness</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>
<ol>
<li>Overspecialisation can cause structural and regional unemployment.</li>

<h1 id="balance-of-payments">Balance of payments</h1>
<ul>
<li>The balance of payments is a financial record of a countryâ€™s transactions with the rest of the world for a given time period, per time period.</li>
<li>The trade balance is <code>X - M</code>, where <code>X</code> represents total export earnings and <code>M</code> represents total import expenditure.</li>
<li>The current account is a component of the balance of payments that records all exports and imports of goods and services and net income flows and transfers with other countries between a country and the rest of the world.</li>
<li>Invisible exports refer to the earnings from selling services to foreign customers.</li>
<li>Invisible imports refer to the spending on services provided from monetary flows.</li>
<li>The invisible trade balance is a record of the trade in services.</li>
<li>Transfers are money flows from one country to another.</li>
<li>Visible exports are goods that are sold to foreign consumers.</li>
<li>Visible imports are goods bought b domestic customers from foreign sellers.</li>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>exchange rate</strong> is the price of one currency measured in terms of other currencies.</li>
<li>A <strong>fixed exchange rate system</strong> exists when the central bank (or monetary authority) buys and sells foreign currencies according to ensure the value of its currency stays at the pegged value.</li>

<li>A <strong>foreign exchange market</strong> is the marketplace where foreign currencies can be bought and sold.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appreciation</strong> of a currency appears when there is an increase in the value of the exchange rate relative to another currency operating in a floating exchange rate system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Depreciation</strong> of a currency appears when there is a fall in the value of the exchange rate relative to another currency operating in a floating exchange rate system.</li>
<li><strong>Devaluation</strong> occurs when the price of a currency operating in a fixed exchange rate system is officially and deliberately lowered.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revaluation</strong> occurs when the price of a currency operating in a fixed exchange rate system is officially and deliberately increased.</li>

<li><strong>Barriers to trade</strong> are obstructions to free trade imposed by a government to safeguard national interests by reducing the competitiveness of foreign firms.</li>
<li><strong>Dumping</strong> is the act of selling exports at artificially low prices, below those charged by domestic firms, and often less than the costs of production.</li>
<li>An <strong>embargo</strong> is a type of protection that involves placing a ban on the trade of a certain good or with a particular country.</li>
<li>A <strong>quota</strong> is a type of protection that sets a numerical limit on the number of imports allowed into a country over a specified time period.</li>
