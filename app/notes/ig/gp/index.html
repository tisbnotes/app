<ul>
<li>Types of information
<ol>
<li>Fact - Pieces of information that are true, and are verifiable by observation and prior knowledge to prove their truth.</li>
<li>Opinion - Beliefs, views or judgements. It is not verifiable by observation, but can be agreed/disagreed with.</li>
<li>Predictions - Attempt to foresee or say what will happen in the future. It is not verifiable by observation until the event occurs.</li>
<li>Value Judgements - Particular kinds of opinions which attempt to differentiate good from bad or right from wrong.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>An issue is a topic or problem that can be debated or discussed.</li>
<li>Cause: something which produces a result; a person or thing which is responsible for a situation, action or event.</li>
<li>Consequence: an effect which follows logically from a cause; something which happens because of another situation, action or event.</li>
<li>Types of perspectives
<ul>
<li>Personal perspectives: this is a perspective that an individual has about an issue. It is influenced by local and national perspectives, but also by the reflective thinking that each individual does.</li>
<li>Local perspectives can be related to a small part of a country, especially when there are differences within a country. Local perspectives can also relate to a region which is much bigger than a country and which can share a common perspective on some issues.</li>
<li>National perspectives are related to a particular country as a whole. National perspectives include:
<ul>
<li>Issues relating to government policy</li>
<li>What is best for the country</li>
<li>The way in which the people of that country see things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Global perspectives are related to the world as a whole.</li>
